[u'cocoa', u'el-salvador', u'usa', u'uruguay']|"BAHIA COCOA REVIEW

Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas. Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop. Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27. Reuter "

[u'usa', u'brazil']|"TALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA BAC> EQUITY OFFER

BankAmerica Corp is not under pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor performance, banking analysts said. Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments on a large portion of its foreign debt. The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon, after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news. Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the First Interstate Bancorp I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term. BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as one of the major factors leading the First Interstate withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9. A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated. ""The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"" said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval. ""I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could,"" said Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith. Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they have to show the market an improved financial outlook. Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible preferred stock would encompass at least part of it. Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group. Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to ease over the coming weeks. Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co. He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show up in the current quarter. With other major banks standing to lose even more than BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

Venezuela and its bank advisory committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last February, bankers said. They declined to disclose details because two or three representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval of their senior management for the new terms. The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today, the bankers said. ""A number of details have still to be finalized, but the broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest rates are in place,"" one senior banker said. The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at 1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year. It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed - and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new investment in Venezuela.

[u'usa', u'reagan']|"TOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN'S HOPES OF REBOUND

The Tower Commission report, which says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in Washington, political analysts said. ""This is certification of incompetence,"" private political analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower report made public today. ""It's as if he went before a professional licensing board and was denied credentials."" In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican senator from Texas, told a press conference, ""The president clearly did not understand the nature of this operation."" The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared by a board of the Republican president's own choosing. The three-member panel made up of Tower, former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party. ""We're falling by our own hand,"" said one Republican political strategist. ""What can we say except 'we're sorry, we won't do it again'?"" The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988 presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said the report was like ""an anvil falling on us."" Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study group, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress, the press and the Washington bureaucracy. The report may also undermine the standing of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping their own skirts clean than supporting the president. ""They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences,"" it said. White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases. Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran initiative and to avoid ""chaos"" in the disclosure process. Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health reasons last month. ""This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of being heroes,"" Tower told reporters. While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers, including command of the armed forces and the right to veto legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly with Congress controlled by the Democrats. The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair. Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms deal with Iran became public last November, his personal popularity is still relatively high. A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was doing a good job as president. American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a Democrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public. ""In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite by appealing directly to the public,"" Schneider said. Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week. But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting a dramatic turnaround. ""The White House has to avoid building expectations that cannot be met,"" said the strategist, who requested anonymity. ""They have to recognize there is no quick fix."" Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity has not always translated into public backing for his policies. They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control of the Senate to the Democrats. Reuter "

inflation plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis. Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250 pct inflation rate. But within a year the plan has all but collapsed. ""The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was inflation, at least the economy worked,"" a leading bank economist said. The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and 1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt. For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs.

A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy in the first quarter of 1987, economists said. With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector, falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy. But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital investment. ""It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. ""I'm particularly impressed by the 19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to tax reform than we thought."" The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in office and computing equipment orders. Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws. ""It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so people just aren't doing it as much,"" Wyss said. Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws, economists said. November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported 0.9 pct. But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused by more than tax reform. ""The wash-out that took place in January was far greater than the actual gains that took place in November and December,"" said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ""The economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."" ""The report definitely points to very sluggish capital spending over the next couple of quarters,"" said Donald Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc. Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said. ""It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which may quickly translate to a drop in production,"" Midland Montagu's Maude said. Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of January's report, given that other reports have reflected strength. But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51 pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in December. He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December. ""Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed to tighten,"" Data Resources' Wyss said. ""But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers like this. The Fed will wait and see,"" he added. Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. ""People aren't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will have to ease to ensure global growth.""

The chairmen and senior Republican members of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to an employee stock ownership plan. The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991. If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions after Sept 26, 1987. The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn), Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen Bob Packwood (R-Ore).

[u'canada', u'maxwell']|"QUEBECOR PQB> HEAD SEES NEW VENTURES LIKELY

Quebecor Inc, one of Canada's largest publishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a new daily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, president Pierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview. The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec government's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company Donohue Inc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper mill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said. ""I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This is not definite but i think we will,"" he said, adding that he plans to announce a decision early next week. Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three daily newspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, the second-largest circulation paper in Canada. A new daily would give Montreal its second English- language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the city the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North America, analysts have said. Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English language tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within six months. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new venture would have the support of major advertisers. Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55 pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of two major Canadian companies who are interested in the project but has not decided whether he would take partners in the newspaper venture. He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures. ""It would be the possibility of doing something else in the short term,"" Peladeau said. Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc BPCL.L> does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects. Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stake in Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the govvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British printing acquiring the other 49 pct. ""In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of newsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper to print the paper,"" Peladeau said. ""When I lived that, I said to myself...next time we'll be ready."" Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprint capacity however, is already committed to other buyers. Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year and Maxwell's company, which publishes Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes. Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49 pct owned by the New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue's 540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies will have to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or build another mill to meet their demands . He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or other types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be on stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane, a depressed area with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the government. Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures with Maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market in France or in the U.S., where the company owns two large printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire. He said Maxwell's sons, who are French citizens, would provide an entree into the French market, where foreigners are prevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in France or the U.S. Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of about 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of two groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiating the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada, Peladeau said. He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers in two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the province. Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its listing on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock Exchange listing. Reuter "

Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier. A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the week to Wednesday. He said that natural float had been ""acting a bit strangely"" for this time of year, noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week. The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday. The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts. For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of adjustments were ""small,"" adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country. The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days. However, he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact. During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions. On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks. The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole.

[u'acq', u'usa']|"AMERICAN EXPRESS AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF

American Express Co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock. American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend. American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume. American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity. Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts' meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes. At the meeting, company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson, according to analysts. Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of president, which had been vacant. It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions. Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff. Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year. ""I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is going to sell shearson,"" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical. He questioned what would be a better investment than ""a very profitable securities firm."" Several analysts said American Express is not in need of cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset. But others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market. Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he believes American Express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past. ""Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization,"" said Eckenfelder. Some analysts said American Express could use capital since it plans to expand globally. ""They have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road,"" said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis. ""They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily in the future, which goes heavily into the international arena,"" said Lewis. ""...That does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way,"" he said. Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might better reflect other assets, such as the travel related services business. ""It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company,"" he said. Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter "

A study on grain certificates due out shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays, administration and industry sources said. Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official told Reuters. GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee. The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March. The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on the program's impact on the USDA loan program. If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up. However, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less. GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said. But a negative report on certificates ""will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program,"" an agricultural consultant said. The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program, while USDA remains firmly committed to it. Reuter "

venezuela is seeking a 'constructive and flexible' attitude from its creditor banks in current talks to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt, finance minister manuel azpurua told a press conference. He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's 13-bank advisory committee except to say, ""they are progressing."" Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil's decision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiate according to its own interest. Asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditors today, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over libor, azpurua said only, ""that is good news."" According to banking sources, the banks' latest offer to venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct Venezuela wants. Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with the banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal payments due in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment schedule, and debt capitalization schemes. Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in public and private debt principal this year. It was due to amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420 mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector. He said venezuela's original proposal was to pay no principal on restructured debt this year, but is now insisting that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank loans. The banking sources said the committee has been prepared to lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but that no direct commitment was likely on new loans. ""debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of financing is guaranteed,"" azpurua said. However, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt payments, ""because circumstances change too quickly."" At the same time, he said the government is presently studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private sector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries. The rules would be published by the finance ministry and the central bank. Reuter "

OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said. ""The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems,"" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets. ""OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way,"" said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December. ""OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,"" said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. ""The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again,"" he added. David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems. ""They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens,"" Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."" Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output. ""OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then,"" said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production. ""Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

Liquefied natural gas imports from Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said. Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in Algiers that such imports would be made this year. ""Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay the import until 1988/1989,"" Daniel Tulis, a natural gas analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said. Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former customers, Panhandle Eastern PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary of Cabot Corp CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington Northern BNI>, has expressed no interest. Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were feasible. ""On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate profitably even in the current price environment,"" Frank Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said. Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend higher by the end of 1987. A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm prices, Shearson's Tulis said. In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added. Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree, saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand. Company sources also said that any negotiations with Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market values. Reuter "
[u'usa']|"U.S. FARM CREDIT RESCUE BILL SEEN BEFORE EASTER

The chairman of the Senate Agriculture subcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farm credit rescue package by Easter even if the system and its regulator do not ask for help by then. ""We're going to have a bill to markup, I guarantee you, before the Easter recess,"" Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said. Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wants recommendations on farm credit presented by April 11, when Congress is scheduled to break for Easter, Boren said. Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the system's regulator, to quickly make a formal request for aid. Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress, the FCA, as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted all its capital and needs federal government help. However, FCA chairman Frank Naylor said because much of the system's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action, he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year and perhaps not even in 1988. The other Republican member of the three-man FCA board, Marvin Duncan, agreed. But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certify aid is needed, it should request help informally. ""We all know we need a capital infusion,"" Boren said. Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on the plight of the farm credit system. Also at the hearing, Brent Beesely, chief executive of the Farm Credit Council representing the system, said that at the end of 1986 the system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining after losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years. While he did not ask for government aid, Beesley indicated the situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts. ""A significant number of banks and associations in the most economically depressed areas have and will continue to suffer extraordinary losses,"" Beesley said. Jim Billington, Democratic member of the FCA board, said the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some one billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay loans. The system's total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by the end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year. FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bonds in the system need to be assured their money is safe. Naylor suggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders. ""The bondholders have no worry at this time,"" Billington said. Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm credit system are circulating. The proposals range from consolidation of the system into a centralized national lender, to de-centralizing into semi-independent institutions. But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious about proposals for a secondary market on farm loans. Those proposals would package farm loans for resale to investors. Naylor and Beesley said a secondary market set-up outside the farm credit system would hurt the system. But Beesley said a secondary market with the farm credit system as its agent could be developed without Congressional legislation. Reuter "
[u'usa', u'reagan']|"REPORT COULD BE FINAL BLOW FOR REGAN

The Tower Commission's scathing comments on President Reagan's embattled chief of staff Donald Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure, but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top officials was less clear. Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of Reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels first emerged last November. But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who said they opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been muted until the release of the Tower Commission report. ""Their obligation was to give the president their full support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the president,"" the report said after a three-month probe. ""Instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program. They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages."" The report saved some of its most scathing language for Regan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House angered some top Reagan officials and, perhaps more importantly, Reagan's wife Nancy. ""More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought to extend this control to the national security adviser,"" said the report. Washington analysts said Regan's departure now appeared to be only a matter of timing. Many expected the president to announce it when he addresses the nation on the Tower Commission's findings next week. With Regan's departure apparently imminent and Poindexter and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the report's tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn the spotlight on their future. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole, a key Reagan ally, told reporters the report disclosed ""colossal blunders"" and said people who had not served the president well should step aside, but he did not specify who should go. ""It would seem to me that if you don't protect the president, you don't serve the president well, then you should move on,"" the Kansas Republican, a likely presidential candidate next year, said. One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not be the only White House official to leave in the near future. Reuter "
[u'cpi', u'gnp', u'switzerland', u'oecd']|"SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS

Switzerland's economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said. This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said. The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern. The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985. But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area. Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986. The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years. But ""given Switzerland's large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances,"" the OECD said. Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted. In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall GDP, it added. The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said. As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986. But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange. The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said. Particularly for the banks, ""recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position,"" it said. REUTER "

The U.S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA officials said. However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in the very near future. ""The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,"" an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. ""But there just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally."" Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week. But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, it could take several months. ""I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process,"" the aide to Lyng said. ""An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,"" said one former USDA official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program. An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets. But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time. The administration's interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said. In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of ""calm, basic, factual economics."" Another USDA official said there was ""not even an informal suggestion or hint"" that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms. USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair.

The U.S. Treasury said it was willing to participate with several other industrial countries in providing a 500 mln-dlr short-term bridge loan to Argentina. The Treasury announcecement did not name the other countries nor the amount of financing the United States was willing to supply. Argentina announced a wage and price freeze on Wednesday night and is negotiating with New York bankers for about 2.15 billion dlrs in new loans and other financing. ""Our willingness to participate in this multilateral short-term financing indicates our support for Argentina's economic program to achieve sustainable growth and a viable balance of payments position,"" the Treassury statement said. In announcing a four-month wage and price freeze, Argentine officials said the country needed ""a more serene climate"" to carry out structural changes in the economy. But Argentina did not suspend interest payments on its foreign debts, as neighboring Brazil did last week. The Treasury said the U.S. share of bridge financing for Argentina would come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund. The one-page statement noted the International Monetary Fund expressed confidence in Argentina's economic policies and prospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement for it on February 18. ""Argentina is expected to qualify for IMF balance-of-payments financing which would enable Argentina to repay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementation of its economic program,"" the statement said. The latest Argentine action marked the second time in less than two years its government has used a wage and price freeze to restrain inflation. The debt talks in New York are being headed by Argentine Finance Minister Mario Brodersohn and are expected to last for several days. Along with new financing, Argentina reportedly wants lower interest rates on an existing total 53 billion dlrs in foreign debt and elimination of foreign banks' control over how some of the money is loaned in Argentina.

Merrell said that to date there have been 12 other trials involving the drug, 10 in the U.S. and two in West Germany. It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company were obtained in eight of the trials, one of which included about 1,150 plaintiffs. In two trials, Merrell said, verdicts were in favor of the plaintiffs.

The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil. The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year. Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number. However, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months. U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said. Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today. ""Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause March to gain on deferreds),"" one CBT crush trader said. ""But they've been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month,"" he added. As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days. The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added. With futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins. A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said. Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added. Reuter "

Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said. ""The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed,"" said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed's policy ""has been unchanged up to today."" Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday. This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added. Today's data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said. ""The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday,"" said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. ""But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous."" ""The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections,"" added Security Pacific's Bannon. A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln. For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period. ""There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings,"" said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said. ""For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,"" said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. ""I expect it to continue in that vein."" ""Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs,"" added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16.

[u'cpi', u'gnp', u'france', u'chirac']|"FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES

France's right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year. Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a 2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint. But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises. And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988. ""The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,"" said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. ""We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year."" ""The big question is whether the government's policy of wage moderation will be maintained,"" he added. The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity. But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices. Calling the government's policies ""unbalanced and unjust,"" he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority. But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands. ""Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that,"" commented Michel Develle, economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas. Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he said. Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent. ""But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed,"" he commented. Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living costs. But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year. Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long as the government kept wages under control. Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute, INSEE, Marais said. But the second half year should be better, he added. Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit, several analysts said. So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth, they said.

Japanese life insurers, trust banks and corporations, largely responsible for vitalising the U.S. Bond market in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in the U.S., Britain, France and Hong Kong, fund managers said. After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years, Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on similar types of investments, they said. Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in 1986, Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd, said. Matsumoto, who manages Nikko's investment research and strategy, said there is evidence Japanese investors began poking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year, but few made firm commitments until December when net purchases suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each of the previous five months. Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added. This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw the widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct of funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets, Matsumoto said. ""The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market, first because of its size and next because it has been successful over the last couple of years,"" said Eugene Atkinson, managing director of Goldman Sachs International Corp. Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity, enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in and out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added. However, few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling. They will remain a Japanese mainstay, fund managers said. Institutions, particularly life insurance companies which concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover payouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their U.S. Treasuries, but will put in less money, said Shinichi Kobuse, manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixed income activities. There has been some selling of U.S. Bonds by short-term investors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to a significant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the liquidity of the U.S. Bond market remains attractive, he added. Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S. Equity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S. Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months. Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports of significant growth in earnings by major U.S. Corporations, he added. Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance Co told an economic conference that insurance companies, which are responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign securities, hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries and intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies. Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their funds into the U.S., But will now invest in Britain, West Germany, France and other countries, Hashimoto said. Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the strength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected to offset currency risks, he added. One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in U.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund investment stategies. The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and European bonds, he said. Japanese investments in British equities have already turned active and the pace is likely to increase, said Andrew Sheaf, general manager of international equity activities at County Securities Japan. ""Last week was the busiest week we had,"" he said. Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of British companies and the recent deregulation of government controlled firms, fund managers said. Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese interest, but stock investments there will be inhibited by worries about the French franc, they said. Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term and speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term political stability, they added. Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany, particularly as German firms, like their Japanese counterparts, are concerned about the recent dollar fall. Australia also poses some risks due to currency values, they added. REUTER "

Japan is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris, Finance Ministry sources said. They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3, abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau. The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses, they said. The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said. However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut, to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct. The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy, they said. On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28. The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said. These ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate, the ministry sources said.

Domestic demand is now expected to make no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here. However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised. But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth. The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points. Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated. ""The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion,"" he said. Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track, Keating said. ""They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time,"" he said. ""On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment."" Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct. ""Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane,"" he said. Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand. He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income. The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year. ""The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88,"" Keating said. ""As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further, and given continued effective wage restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,"" he said. REUTER "

Talks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil""s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world""s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. The big producers ""want to have the ball only in their court and it isn""t fair,"" minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30, delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. ""Anything is possible at this phase,"" even adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said. Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either, they said.

Indonesia""s agriculture sector will grow by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report. Production of Indonesia""s staple food, rice, is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on Indonesia""s agricultural performance. The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987. The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks. ""Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain,"" the report says. ""The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels."" Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines. The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as ""wereng"" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields. The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types. The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices. Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says. But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September""s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand. The report said that Indonesia""s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984. The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump. REUTER "

Kuwait""s Oil Minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying: ""None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting."" He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd. ""This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,"" the minister said. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd. ""If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,"" he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered ""a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices."" Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate. However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC""s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body""s members. Ecuador""s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec""s pricing committee.

Indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year""s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto""s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy. ""(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,"" the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia""s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country""s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, ""there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves."" ""This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,"" the report says. Indonesia""s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia""s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. ""This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s,"" the report notes. Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. ""For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry."" ""Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture,"" the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said. REUTER "

Opposition politicians, businessmen and newspapers criticised India""s newly unveiled 1987/88 budget and large projected deficit of around 57 billion rupees. They said the budget failed to provide incentives for economic growth and merely tinkered with tax reform. But few politicians were prepared to criticise a sharp rise in defence expenditure in the Hindu-majority nation where playing on fear of aggression by Moslem Pakistan has proved a vote winner. The Indian Express, the country""s biggest selling paper, said: ""The defence cow has never been holier."" The Sunday Mail newspaper branded the budget ""shamelessly political."" It said in a front page commentary the ""budget is bad for growth, bad for prices, bad for the stock market and neutral in respect of everything else."" Businessmen polled by Reuters said the budget had done little for them. Gandhi announced small increases in poverty alleviation and education outlays but he ordered a hold-down on current expenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. He told ministries to curb spending and promised a review of money-losing public sector industries. Gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts but otherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisation policy launched two years ago. Reaction in Bombay, India""s business capital, was generally unfavourable. Businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposals for closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. It also failed to boost industrial investment and productivity needed to lift real economic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the 1985-90 development plan. Nalin Vissanji, President of the Indian Merchants Chambers of Commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capital market and had not fulfilled a government pledge to remove surtax on corporate income. Shares on The Bombay Stock Exchange, India""s biggest, fell in a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed Gandhi""s proposal to set up a regulatory board for the securities industry. The exchange was shaken last year by several scandals and trading was suspended several times. Brokers said trading volume may increase with the change in capital gains tax on stock sales. Stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead of three years without incurring capital gains tax.

The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.

Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. ""Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts,"" he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. ""Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind,"" he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had ""clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region."" In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is ""no bond market to speak of"" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said. REUTER "

A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy. The NAPM report, based on a survey of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. Industrial companies, also found that the growth rate in new orders and production slowed in February. But production remained vigorous, with more than three times as many members reporting it better rather than worse. Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members reported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp gradually resumed production. The same number of members reported inventories were higher as reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984. For a sixth straight month, more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.

Indonesia's wheat imports are expected to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln in 1986, the U.S. Embassy's annual agriculture report said.

Zambia will retain its foreign-exchange auction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since January 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said. ""We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been abolished at all,"" he told Reuters in an interview. He said the system would be reintroduced after current talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds. Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private bidders but not to fix the exchange rate. Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand. It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible for the government and the private sector, he said. Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months. In January 1987 the government was more than two months in arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

[u'belgium', u'ec']|"EC MINISTERS CONSIDER BIG AGRICULTURE PRICE CUTS

European Community (EC) agriculture ministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests by European farmers, Community officials said. The common target for the farmers' wrath is the EC's Brussels Commission, which for the fourth year running has called for radical changes in the price support system. EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen says huge food surpluses, which have alienated international trade partners and pushed the Community to the edge of bankruptcy, demand such action. With Community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes of unwanted cereals, over one mln tonnes of butter and huge stocks of wine and olive oil, Andriessen says bluntly the days of open-ended price guarantees must end. EC agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices paid to Community farmers before an April 1 deadline for the new marketing year, an increasingly difficult task as EC members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline. Andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices, coupled with reductions in other support mechanisms, which could lead to price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products. A producer's right to sell into EC warehouses at a fixed guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases. The latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on agriculture virtually stable. EC farm policies now swallow two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion European currency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected shortfall this year of about five billion Ecus. The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils and fats tax and a change in the ""green"" exchange rate system, which translates EC farm prices into national currencies. The tax, of up to 330 Ecus per tonne, would be levied on imported and domestically produced oilseeds, but could trigger a fresh trade dispute with the United States, which provides the EC with the bulk of its soybeans. It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter consumption. West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes, which would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with weak and strong currencies were brought more into line. REUTER "

The country now has foreign debt totalling 27.8 billion dlrs and faces debt repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs due between January 1987 and December 1992. Manila also hopes to tack on another 5.8 billion dlrs, rescheduled in a 1985 accord, to any new agreement, the officials said. Chile's 15-1/2 year rescheduling accord at one percentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) and Venezuala's 21 billion dlr package at 7/8 point over LIBOR portend well for the Philippines, despite Brazil's repayment suspension last week, the officials said. Manila, which has not made any principal repayments since 1983, wants terms better than the 20-year repayments at 13/16 percentage point over LIBOR offered in October to Mexico in a 77 billion dlr rescue. Ongpin wants 5/8 point over the benchmark rate, which is currently hovering around 6-1/2 pct.

Saudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources said. They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp XON>, Mobil Corp MOB>, Texaco Inc TX> and Chevron Corp CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries.

After an onslaught of new paper, fewer mark eurobonds issues are expected this week, bankers said. Most managers said they were planning a low issue volume for the Bundesbank's two-week bond calendar beginning today. ""We want to have a week's pause,"" one manager said. Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks, including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank. Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks, from 3.6 billion in January. The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very best addresses were having to accept higher coupons. ""I think the D-mark market is still good, but only if you can give a good coupon,"" another manager said. But even some government borrowers were not getting the best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more readily under other conditions. Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone, bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside fees on Friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows. Den Danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Friday at 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and Iceland's 6-1/2 pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price. A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone was also depressed, but traded Friday within fees at 98.15, 98.50 from its par price. Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the 10-year NTT and Iceland issues, a five-year six pct bond for Hoogovens, traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price, thanks mainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said. The large amount of paper brought to the market in the last two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain about the Bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, which they say is too inflexible. Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be registered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding the two-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond on the requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the next calendar period to schedule the bond again. Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system. The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks from four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to be completely abolished. ""I don't think the Bundesbank would give that up,"" one banking analyst said. ""I wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system,"" the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the volume of new issues themselves. The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar without trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through the euromarket, he said. For this reason, few managers here foresee the Bundesbank sacrificing its present calendar system. Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndication departments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing to the carnival holiday. Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday. In Frankfurt, banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon. REUTER "

Iraq has secured agreement to defer outstanding payments on a 500 mln dlr syndicated euroloan following five months of negotiations with creditor banks. Banking sources said the rescheduling is part of Iraq's continuing effort to defer payments of foreign debt as its economy comes under strain from the Gulf War and soft world oil prices. Iraq informed the 37 banks in the loan syndicate last September it could not meet the remaining four principal repayments totalling 285 mln dlrs, and missed the first of these for 71.25 mln due on September 29. The 500 mln dlr credit, under the lead management of Paris-based Union de Banques Arabes et Francaises (UBAF), has a five-year maturity and a margin of one percentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR). Banking sources said the agreement now worked out goes some way to meeting creditor bank demands that at least part of the first missing instalment of 71.25 mln dlrs be paid and not deferred. One quarter or 17.8 mln dlrs will be paid on signature of the accord, expected in late March, with the remainder in three more instalments to be made every six months. The remaining three principal instalments - originally due in March 1987, September 1987 and March 1988 - will each be deferred for two years from the due date, banking sources said. The margin for the loan remains unchanged and no penalty interest is being imposed, the sources added. Bank reaction to Iraq's rescheduling request has been one of resignation, with many bankers seeing little alternative for Baghdad's economic planners. Iraq is estimated to have foreign debt of about 50 billion dlrs, although about half is thought to be in the form of loans from its Gulf Arab allies, particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The 500 mln dlr credit is in the name of the state-owned Rafidain Bank. The only other major eurocredit, a 500 mln dlr deal under the agency of Gulf International Bank, was signed in October, 1985 and is still in a two year grace period. The bulk of Iraq's commercial debt - excluding loans by its allies in the Gulf War - is in the form of trade financing. But Rafidain bank stopped paying debt due on letters of credit last March and a series of negotiations with banks and western government export credit agencies has been underway. Some banks have agreed to a three-year deferrment of obligations due on letters of credit. REUTER "

Japanese securities houses will issue new corporate bonds more quickly, accept issue requests throughout the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive underwriting method from April 1, to bring Japanese firms back to the Tokyo bond market, securities managers said. Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, but the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of public bond issues, they said. ""Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only to straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds and warrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from overseas markets,"" a Nikko Securities house bond manager said. Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now, the securities managers said. Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance system, in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end, and accept issue requests during the month, they said. Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in order to better reflect the market, securities managers said. Market participants expect the new issue methods to be applied beginning in April, with the projected issue by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp>. The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented decisions on terms, securities sources said. The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns underwriting corporate bonds. Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest public bonds is now almost automatic, they said. The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond market, securities house managers said. The finance ministry, commissioned banks and securities houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and convertible bonds from March 1, securities managers said. The cut will more than double the number of corporations able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight bonds and 180 for convertibles now, securities managers said. The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration system, more use of corporate ratings systems and simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing process, securities sources said. It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank system, which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds, and for deregulation of private placements, they said. Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put into effect, the sources said. A shelf registration system would need a revision of Japanese commercial law, expected in 1988, the sources said. REUTER "

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likely to leave office this summer amid opposition to his controversial tax-reform package, political analysts said. They said Nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician has suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct sales tax planned for January 1988. ""Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the end of his administration, which is not only impossible but also is very irresponsible as a politican,"" Rei Shiratori, professor of politics at Dokkyo University, told Reuters. ""Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as parliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer,"" Shiratori said. Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of parliament have spoken against the tax, which Nakasone says is needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes. Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP members who oppose the tax. ""There are some who are objecting because of their constituencies,"" he told a meeting of government and party leaders. ""If the party discipline is broken, I would like to see punishment considered."" ""A proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partly because Nakasone breached his election pledge against introducing it,"" Shiratori said. ""Moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feels uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's appreciation and about the future when the Japanese society is rapidly aging,"" he said. Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect the more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for April, involving governors, mayors, town and village heads and assemblies at all levels. But the situation is complicated, since opposition parties excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with the LDP, the political analysts added. Shiratori said, ""In the worst case, implementation of the sales tax, now scheduled for next January, may be put off for some time before the government makes a final decision. ""Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to perhaps three pct. ""A third alternative for the government is to ram through the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs,"" he said. Seizaburo Sato, professor of politics at Tokyo University, thought the last possibility most likely. ""I think the LDP alone will take a vote on the tax bills,"" he said. The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and 143 in the 252-seat Upper House.

Thailand's Commerce Ministry announced a new tapioca export quota of 737,987 tonnes for the European Community against 762,860 tonnes for the previous allocation. The ministry said the fresh allocation, for the February 27-July 7 shipment period, is the third under a maximum 5.5 mln tonne overall quota that Thailand obtained from the EC for calendar 1987. It said the quota allocation was based on a national tapioca pellet stock of 4.34 mln tonnes surveyed last week, up from 3.05 mln in mid-January. REUTER "

Mine and industry officials from most member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636. In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo, Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate. Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively during the quota period. REUTER "

[u'philippines']|"SAN MIGUEL BOARD APPOINTMENT MAY MEAN CHANGES

Disagreement over management of San Miguel Corp> (SMC) may follow the Philippine government's appointment of a well-known banker to the SMC board, investment analysts said. They told Reuters the presence of United Coconut Planters Bank> (UCPB) president Ramon Sy to the board of SMC may mean changes in SMC management, which for decades was controlled by the family of its president, Andres Soriano. Sy was appointed by a government commission that controls 51 pct of San Miguel's stock, after another nominee resigned. The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) holds six seats on the 15-member SMC board, which represent 33.13 mln sequestered shares. The stocks were seized on suspicion that they were owned by Eduardo Cojuangco, then chairman of UCPB and San Miguel. He was a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos, and he left the country after Marcos's fall. Before the seizure, Soriano led a 3.3 billion peso bid for the shares, paying UCPB a 500 mln peso deposit. The bid valued the shares at about 100 pesos. They traded at 93 pesos today, down from 95.50 at Friday's close. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters on Saturday that Sy would definitely sit on the SMC board despite the objections of some directors associated with Soriano. ""I don't think there is a conflict of interest as such,"" he said. ""I was potentially concerned with seeing a situation where you have a contentious atmosphere on the board. But Sy has assured (the government) that he does not intend to behave in a contentious manner,"" Ongpin added. The Soriano group cited conflict of interest in opposing Sy's directorship. Its lawyer said in a letter to the PCGG that a pending suit seeking forfeiture of SMC's 500 mln peso deposit and major undisclosed damages against the brewery represented a clear conflict. UCPB, however, sought board representation before Sy's appointment, petitioning the PCGG ""so that the interests of the owners of the 33 mln shares would be adequately protected."" Investment analysts polled by Reuters said the UCPB had a right to a slot on the SMC board as trustee for coconut farmers who claim ownership of the disputed shares. The analysts said Sy, backed by the government, would probably suggest replacements for PCGG nominees expected to resign soon in keeping with a new law prohibiting government officials from working for private companies. SMC's annual election is scheduled for May. A UCPB spokesman declined to comment, saying it was up to the PCGG to decide whom to appoint. One analyst said objections were understandable from the family that founded the company 97 years ago. ""It is a natural instinct of self-preservation for Soriano,"" he said. SMC posted a net income of 448.8 mln pesos in 1985 on net sales of 10.99 billion pesos against 422.3 mln in 1984 on sales of 10.36 billion. REUTER "

[u'india', u'gandhi']|"INDIAN BUDGET DEFICIT SEEN FUELING INFLATION

Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's fiscal 1987/88 budget has sparked speculation that a large deficit will push up India's moderate inflation rate and that the country's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty, economists, politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters. The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88, ending March, is 56.88 billion rupees, down from an upwardly revised estimate of a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87. The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87, based on wholesale prices, is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86. Economists pointed out that the government itself had expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87 economic survey report published last week. Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday, Prime Minister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to trim large non-development expenditures. The deficit for 1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure, he said. But few analysts have taken Gandhi's assurance seriously. They say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from an initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees. Lal Krishna Advani, president of the opposition Bharatiya Janata party, said Gandhi's failure to mention specific measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices. Economists said increased liquidity in the economy, as reflected by expansion of the M3 aggregate money supply, may cause prices to rise. The survey report showed the M3 rose by 15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of 1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86 period. Economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects, after bad weather last year, may strain prices further. Economists said the deficit would also cause the government to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. Market loans and bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88, up from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion. No reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes, which will discourage savings, economists said. Avinash Purulkar, chief manager of the state-owned Union Bank of India, said the annual inflation rate may double to around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency notes to cover the deficit. Brokers said stock market investors have started selling long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the budget that reduces the holding period required to claim exemption from the capital gains tax to one year from three. Delhi stockbroker B. D. Aggarwal said, ""There is uncertainty in the market. There is going to be growing selling pressure."" But Bombay broker Dinesh Walji said the present hectic selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the scene. ""Just now there is acute nervousness in the market,"" he said. Brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help small investors buy equity shares and relaxations in the capital gains tax will inject further buoyancy into the market on a long-term basis. New equity and debenture issues, both convertible and non-convertible, rose to an officially estimated 50.70 billion rupees in April/January 1986/87 from an estimated 36.95 billion in all 1985/86 and 20 billion in all 1984/85.

[u'hungary', u'imf']|"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTERITY MEASURES IN HUNGARY

Hungary is to embark on a new series of austerity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled last year after quadrupling in 1985. The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by Parliament last December was 43.8 billion forints. But Zoltan Boesze, chief of the Finance Ministry's budget financing division, told Reuters the government now saw this as too high and had decided ""quite severe"" measures were needed. ""All the organizations of economic management have been charged with elaborating further (savings) measures,"" he said. Asked if these measures were being taken under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Boesze said: ""The Fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results, and of course the Fund would support these efforts."" IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year. Boesze said preliminary figures showed that Hungary's state budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984. The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints because of poor performance by state firms, which needed subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency. The exact extent and nature of savings are still under discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest budget item -- must definitely fall, Boesze said. Subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain low consumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164 billion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985. Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints. ""I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies,"" Boesze said. ""The central administration must be hard. ... If we are not hard then we will not be successful."" Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and 800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. ""I believe these reserves should not be used at all,"" he said. Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic product, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct. The authorities had already signalled a small fall in real wages for 1987, but Boesze said firms will suffer severe tax penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct. This would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986. A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1. About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and 33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices. Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant cuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made this difficult. But he added: ""I think ultimately we will be able to make curtailments in subsidies in this area as well."" He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at the beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and value added tax. The IMF supports these aims. Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in an attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms. Between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to be unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline is being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily. Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to shed labour. He gave no exact figures. Istvan Nagy, a senior Finance Ministry official responsible for drafting the bankrupcy law, told Reuters last year he hoped the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct. After subsidies to state enterprises, the largest single budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion). Interest payments on international debt are set to rise to more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven billion in 1986, Boesze said. Hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year to 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, while trade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of more than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years earlier. Boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pct by credits from the National Bank, mostly from abroad, and 10 pct by the issue of domestic state bonds. Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarian economists in a speech this month that the country's economy was in a ""very difficult"" situation, but not in crisis. There would have to be a turnround with tangible results this year, however, and borrowing must be used more effectively. ""Any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous,"" Berecz said.

Japanese consumers hesitated about buying the controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on sale in Tokyo today, but said the DAT player's near-perfect sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper. ""The sound is great, but I'll wait until more machines hit the market and prices fall to about 100,000 yen before buying one,"" said Terumi Fujitsuka, 35, a steel firm employee. Aiwa, Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players today although delivery will take about two weeks, retailers said. Aiwa's machine, the cheapest, is listed at 188,000 yen. Machines by Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba and others will appear as early as the end of March, industry sources said. DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior to even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size of the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with almost no loss of sound quality. This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape piracy and loss of royalties. In negotiations that delayed the DAT player's debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry be built into the machines. Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to prevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can still be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier. ""Nobody can tell the difference,"" one salesman said. DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanese hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a profitable niche. Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly, possibly to around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put their products on the market, industry analysts said. They said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units per year. Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT player on the world market later this year. REUTER "
[u'italy']|"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ITALIAN BOOM

Italy's strong economic revival has led some observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in some quarters about future growth prospects, but many Italian experts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive. ""I think all this foreign interest in the so-called Italian miracle is really exaggerated...Foreign observers always oscillate in the case of Italy between complete pessimism and unwarranted optimism,"" says Luigi Spaventa, one of Italy's leading economists and a professor at Rome University. According to Spaventa, these violent swings of mood have been occurring for the last 15 years, with Italy one minute seen as the ""bad boy of Europe"" and unable to raise a dollar and the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration, ""I think there's a lot of exaggeration...Once it used to be the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign newspapers flocked to Italy to study this. That was another story about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a dark room."" Spaventa, in tune with other economists and industrialists here, stress Italy's recent achievements, particularly the dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial enterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable. Profits of private sector firms such as Fiat S.P.A., FIAT.M> and ING. C. Olivetti and C. S.P.A.> are booming, the major state industries are back in the black after years of losses, inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of payments deficits have been slashed. Expectations by some experts that Italy is poised to replace Britain as the world's fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism. Italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it feels to be its second-rate status among the major industrialised countries. Only this week, it angrily demanded clarification of this status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five (G-5) - comprising the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain. Italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an agreement reached in Tokyo last year to let Italy and Canada attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned managing the international monetary system. But Italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems still facing its economy, economists and industrialists say. ""We must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy,"" warns Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti. He says that while Italy's recent achievements are indeed cause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be on the problems still remaining rather than those already solved. The country's huge state sector deficit, high unemployment and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most worrying problems, experts say. The size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at 109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billion lire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral again, says Carlo Scognamiglio, head of the private Luiss university in Rome. Inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a decade in September 1984 and by January this year was running at 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guarantee international competiveness, economists and industrialists say. And unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last October according to the latest official data. Recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million people seeking work in October 1986, almost 73 pct were aged between 14 and 29. Unemployment in the south was running at 17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recently forecast that Italian gross domestic product (GDP) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct in 1986. But it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to check rising unemployment. Another problem is Italy's reliance on imported raw materials. The country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs. This factor actually worked sharply in Italy's favour last year, when lower energy costs helped slash the country's trade deficit to 3,717 billion lire by year end from 23,085 billion lire in 1985. But economists say the improvement owes little to any structural change in the Italian economy and that any reversal of the trend in costs could have serious consequences. If Italy truly wants to be counted among the world's top industrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarket operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality information about their activities, economists say. Italy has no controls on insider trading. The country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements controls -- a European Community directive calls for these to be dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less blinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating procedures, economists say. ""Even today, if I wanted to invest in the Tokyo bourse, I doubt I'd find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks which would allow me to do that,"" says Spaventa. REUTER "

Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said. ""We appreciate their frustration,"" a senior Japanese government official said. ""But we are also frustrated."" The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress. ""It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments,"" a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. ""It condemns Japan without due process,"" one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said. Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them. ""We have no leverage,"" one official admitted. As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said.

According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EC had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the EC market if they continue at the same pace.

He did not give details but said, ""It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing."" Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the country's 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years. It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price.

Ongpin said last month the country's consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors had endorsed a growth facility to bridge the funding gap. He said the government and the consultative group would meet annually to gauge financing needs for each year. The aid donors and commercial bank creditors would then be asked to finance any gap on a shared basis. He told reporters on Saturday it would be unwise to try to pin the banks down on Monsod's proposed growth facility. Ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics. ""Secretary Monsod and I get along famously,"" he said. ""She talks and I listen but I don't necessarily agree."" Monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridging the financing gap would have aided the government's pump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan. She said if private sector investment continued to be held back by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and rising interest rates, the country would fail to achieve its gross national product (GNP) growth target of an average 6.5 pct over the next six years. ""If you don't get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan. How can there be a program if there is no finance?"" she said, adding Ongpin's stand was not good for the economy.

The group, due to be privatised at an unspecified date, said in January it was planning a capital increase to pursue its development strategy and make further acquisitions. Rhone-Poulenc shares were suspended from trading on the Paris Bourse last Thursday ahead of the capital increase. The group's capital currently stands at 4.03 billion francs. Fourtou, speaking at a news conference, did not give details of acquisitions the company planned for 1987. He said acquisitions in 1987 would complement an industrial investment program of around five billion francs, and research spending of about 3.5 billion francs.

Hutchison Whampoa Ltd HWHH.HK> expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not make any specific projections for the company's earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue. It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year, equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share split. Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper, compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining shares. Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth. Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct. But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S. May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the British colony. He said all of the company's major operations showed improved results in 1986. Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd HKEH.HK> to Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric. Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share. Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares. The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish. Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from the government for the spin-off. He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.

The French inflation rate is expected to show a substantial improvement in February after January's very high 0.9 pct monthly rate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said.

""Now, taking account of this inflation index, our forecast for price rises this year is two and a half pct,"" he said. Balladur said the upward revision of the inflation target, which the government had initially set at two pct for this year, should not affect wage expectations for this year.

The U.S. economy continued to expand in February, but at a slower pace than in January which saw a spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) said in a report. The Association's composite survey index declined to 51.9 pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator was over 50 pct. A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy. The report, based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies, also found that the growth rate in new orders and production slowed in February. However, production remained vigorous as more than three times as many members reported it better rather than worse. Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members reported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel X> gradually resumed production. An equal number of members reported inventories were higher and lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984. For a sixth month, more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.

Brazil would not have suspended payments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received more and faster financing from official lending agencies, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. He said he would not seek more money from the International Monetary Fund to which Brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year and said Brazil's problems could not be solved by IMF intervention. ""It's a question of why the official lending agencies don't finance a little bit more quickly and easily,"" Funaro told reporters at the Brazilian Embassy. Asked if Brazil would have continued making payments of monthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders if official lending agencies had provided more funds, he replied, ""Yes, because our country did not receive financing from these agencies."" Asked how long the payment suspension would last, Funaro said ""It all depends on what kind of financing we are going to receive from the other side."" Brazil, with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs, stunned the banking community last week by suspending payments on some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks. Funaro said Brazil had paid 44 billion dollars to the World Bank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in the past four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans. He said the net transfer was hurting the country's continued growth and capacity to import goods. ""Something is wrong with the system. Some mechanism has to be found to finance a country like Brazil,"" Funaro said. He did not specify what steps he had in mind but said he would like to see ""automatic"" official lending when needed so that Brazil would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves, now reported to be below four billion dlrs. Funaro said Brazil had the world's third-largest trade surplus and estimated the 1987 surplus would be at least eight billion dlrs. But he said that without increased and faster lending from official institutions, the nation could not rely on its export earnings to finance development and imports and also service its debt. ""We must find an equilibrium between foreign adjustment and internal adjustment,"" Funaro said. He complained that official lending agencies had imposed tight control on credit over the past four years, leaving commercial bank refinancing as the only credit available. Funaro said U.S officials understand his position ""but they don't like it."" Later he left Washington for a tour of Europe and debt discussions with officials in Britain, West Germany, France, Switzerland and Italy. Brazil's central cank President Francisco Gros said he sent a telex to creditor banks Friday to clarify confusion over Brazil's request that banks expedite procedures for renewal of short-term interbank credit and trade credit lines.

[u'acq', u'usa']|"AMERICAN EXPRESS AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS

American Express Co, rumored to be considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet broadening international competition. In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said the actions under consideration are an integral part of American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters. American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place. Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public. There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was considered highly unlikely, analysts said. American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74. It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees. Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year. Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm. Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. American Express' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling. ""(American) Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to,"" said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities. Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president. The reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company. Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition. Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F. Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage. Reuter "

Switzerland recorded last year its first overall surplus in government finances since 1974, ending with a net gain worth 905 mln Swiss francs, the Finance Ministry said. The surplus, including cash transactions and long-term investments, contrasted with the 1985 shortfall of 1.06 billion francs and the 297 mln franc deficit proposed in the 1986 budget. All categories of revenues were higher than forecast, and expenditures were 433 mln francs under forecast. The Finance Ministry said expenditures totalled 23.18 billion francs against 22.88 billion in 1985 and the 23.61 billion proposed in the original 1986 budget. Tax receipts, at 25.11 billion, were well above the 1985 figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71 billion. This left a surplus on cash transactions totalling 1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985 deficit of 696 mln. Income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs above forecast, 378 mln of which came from higher than expected receipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions. Taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more than planned and other taxes 16 mln francs more, the ministry said. The ministry said the improvement in the overall account reflected years of efforts by the government and parliament to introduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary tax increases. But economic factors, including the low rate of inflation, the weak dollar, falling interest rates and low oil prices were also important factors. A spokesman for the ministry said the government had used its improved cash position to retire about one billion francs of government debt, which accounted for the difference between the 1.94 billion surplus on cash transactions and the 905 mln franc overall surplus.

Both of the new machines, the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II, will be faster and more versatile, but considerably more expensive than earlier models. The Mac SE (SE stands for ""system expansion""), which Apple says will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current Mac Plus, goes on sale today. It carries a suggested retail price ranging from 2,899 to 3,699 dlrs depending on its features. The Mac II, designed to run about four times faster than the Mac Plus, is to be ready for shipping in May and priced between 4,798 and 6,998 dlrs. Mac Plus, which went on the market one year ago, sells for about 2,200 dlrs. Both new computers are to be unveiled at the AppleWorld Conference in Los Angeles. Company officials expressed high hopes for both computers at a press briefing on Friday, especially the high-performance Mac II which is designed to give Apple an entree to the expanding market for science and engineering workstations. John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive officer, declined to estimate anticipated sales, but he said the Mac SE should contribute significantly to Apple's bottom line this year. He said it would appeal to the mainstream of PC users. ""I believe the Mac SE will be the product of choice for most people,"" he said. ""My sense is that it will be a real power product for revenue."" Bruce Lupatkin, senior technology analyst with Hambrecht Quist in San Francisco, said he had not seen the new computers but expected the new products to do well. ""Apple has recognized the need for a convergence of computer functions into one general all-purpose workstation,"" he told Reuters. ""The graphics interface on the Mac products is significantly better than anything IBM has to date."" International Business Machines is expected to announce updated personal computers this spring. The Mac II uses the new Motorola 68020 microprocessor, an ""open architecture"" that allows for the addition of numerous peripheral devices, a built-in hard disk and one megabyte of memory, expandable to eight megabytes. It can be equipped with a 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor.

The Mac II can be upgraded so that its monitor displays 256 colors or shades of gray. The Mac SE is built around the 68000 microprocessor and will be shipped with one megabyte RAM, expandable to four megabytes, and a nine-inch monochrome screen.

Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from another courier company. Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F.

Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the firm is reviewing its options on Stant. Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet. E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to complete the transaction. This so-called ""bridge"" financing will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.

The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of 200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp's RPT> RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman, Sachs and Co ran the books on that deal, with First Boston acting as co-manager. However, Dub said the Bank of America securities were more closely related to the so-called ""cars deals"" that raced to market last year than were the RepublicBank securities. ""The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit card receivables. In contrast, the Bank of America deal was the first public offering of credit card receivables because we used a grantor trust vehicle,"" he said. In a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest in the trust, analysts explained. The Bank of America certificates were issued by California Credit Card Trust A, which the bank established for that single purpose, investment bankers pointed out. The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in 1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over comparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life, the deal was rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's. Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the Bank of America deal was priced too aggressively. ""AAA-rated auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasuries when First Boston priced the deal,"" one said. However, Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway. The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal's top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's cars deals, which were rated by S and P alone. ""Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18 months and then interest and principal payments for the remaining five to seven months,"" Dub detailed. Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank of America deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals that were brought to market late last year. The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA credit card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. Bank of America has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making it one of the biggest in the U.S., analysts said. Last week's deal was Bank of America's second foray into the young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted. In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold, via California Cars Grantor Trust 1986-A, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backed by automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc. Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes backed by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp, a unit of Volvo Finance North America Inc, via First Boston, and 450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack Trucks Receivables Corp, a unit of Mack Trucks Inc MACK>, via Shearson Lehmand Brothers Inc. The asset backed market, which began in March 1985, totals an estimated 11.9 billion dlrs. Reuter "

After a week that left his presidency shaken and his popularity at a new low, Ronald Reagan and his new chief of staff today begin trying to revive an administration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal. Reagan and former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker, whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisan praise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms with Iran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon. Among the chores facing Reagan's new inner circle is assessing the damage the 300-page Tower commission report has done to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Casey as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency. White House officials are checking to see how much support Gates, a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat, would have if his nomination is submitted to the full Senate for a vote, Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said. Appearing on the NBC News program, ""Meet the Press,"" the Kansas senator said the Gates nomination ""could be in some difficulty."" Aides said that Gates' future would be given high priority by Baker. Even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale scandal, lawmakers said Senate confirmation of the Gates nomination is not assured and, even if won, would come only after months of congressional probes into the affair. ""He has the smell of Iran on him,"" said former Nevada Sen. and Reagan confidant Paul Laxalt. ""He is a victim."" Laxalt, appearing on the ABC News program, ""This Week With David Brinkley,"" bluntly admitted ""the Gates nomination is in trouble."" Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said the odds are now slightly against confirmation of Gates. When asked on the syndicated television program, ""John McLaughlin: One on One,"" if he thought Gates would be confirmed, the Georgia Democrat shot back: ""I wouldn't bet any money on it. ""I think this report hurts that,"" Nunn said. ""It indicates that the National Security Council had policy-type influence over intelligence-type activities and we're going to go into that with Mr. Gates. Only a day after it was issued last week, the Tower report prompted the abrupt exit of Donald Regan as White House chief of staff. Regan, the former Wall Street executive and Treasury secretary who has been the president's top aide for the past two years, was assigned the lion's share of the blame for the botched handling of the Iran arms sale. The report blamed Regan for the ""chaos that descended on the White House"" since it was first revealed last November that profits from the Iran arms sales had been diverted to contra rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government. The two other victims of the scandal are former National Security Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter who resigned and Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North who was fired after it was disclosed last November 23 that profits from the Iran arms sale were diverted to the contras. The two, pictured by the Tower commission as the key operators of the Iran arms deal, have refused to testify. Reagan, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayed in the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy. That perception has wrecked Reagan's popularity and threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves office in January 1989. A recent Newsweek magazine poll found that just 40 pct of Americans approved of Reagan's leadership, a record low, and a third believed he should consider resignation. After meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over the meaty report of the commission headed by former Texas Sen. John Tower, Reagan is now preparing for a nationwide television address this week to respond to the criticisms of his presidency. Reuter "

Brazil is not happy with the existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said, adding ""This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks."" The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983, however. Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and European banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis, ""Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors,"" central bank president Francisco Gros said. Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs. Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain, France, West Germany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments. Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton. Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around 8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K. The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan. The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chief means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country'sate of inflation. Reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs. Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems with Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt. ""What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service, because we cannot service all that,"" he said. ""I really think we have to change the old rules."" Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments, rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis, Funaro said ""We must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks, because the banks have some limits."" ""It is a political discussion from our point of view,"" he said. Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to Japanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talk to the commercial banks ""If I've got some solution from the governments. I can't take the burden only to the banks."" He was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution. In discussions with governments Brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since 1982. ""You must open these mechanisms,"" he said. He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed by Brazil's suspension of interest payments, they understood Brazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves. Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed ""because we can't stay as we were the last few years."" ""I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium."" he said. Although Brazil has rejected a substantive role for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy, Funaro paid a call in Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to World Bank President Barber Conable. Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to decline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in 1987. Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus had declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last year, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months. Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world, Funaro said, although its share of international trade was only one pct. ""The solution is linked with growth, not recession,"" he said, noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to service debt. Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments, as opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sounder structure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt.

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson has told Brazil's Finance Minister Dilson Funaro that negotiations on Brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter for the commercial banks themselves, a Treasury spokesman said. The spokesman said the Chancellor had emphasised in talks this morning with Funaro the need for the Brazilian authorities to be able to present a convincing economic program to the country's creditors. He added an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could be a very helpful support. Brazil on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks. Lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a clear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining official cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis. Funaro, accompanied by central bank president Francisco Gros, is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in an attempt to explain to governments Brazil's indefinite suspension of interest payments earlier this month. Brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the IMF in managing its economy, arguing that an IMF austerity program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption would lead to recession and threaten democracy. Funaro and Gros last week visited Washington as part of their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts to change the means by which developing countries finance growth. Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that Brazil would not have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and faster financing from international agencies. He said earlier today that Brazil was first approaching governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves about the interest payment moratorium ""because the banks have some limits.... It's a political discussion from our point of view."" Funaro said on Friday that his talks with U.S. Officials had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve Brazil's debt crisis, describing the meeting as an initial contact. He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker. The Treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had been at Funaro's request. After travelling this week to France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next week before starting negotiations with banks. REUTER "

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs. Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs. The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover. Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom management which is competing with Redstone for control of the company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom. The company did not disclose the details of the revised offers, but said a special committee of its board would review them later today. The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom, and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for at least half of the outstanding stock. The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements, which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided they keep the information secret. In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs. Besides the financing it would raise through a bank syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs, Redstone said. Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said. Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln dlrs in equity toward the takeover. The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said. The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.

Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a ""voluntary"" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program, particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments. The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes. Reuter "

Directors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will meet Wednesday to consider a membership petition asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading activities in the widely-popular Standard and Poor's 500 Stock Index futures pit, an exchange executive said. The petition calls for elimination of dual trading, a legal practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade for their own account. But exchange officials noted this practice also provides an opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called ""front-running"", where traders enter orders for their own account before executing orders for their customers. Leo Melamed, CME special counsel, said directors will rule on the petition on Wednesday, but added that a special S and P Advisory Committee has been studying S and P 500 futures trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to submit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days. In addition to a recommendation on dual trading, Melamed said the special committee will also make suggestions about a possible automatic order entry and execution system for S and P 500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that would alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit. Melamed said directors are likely to approve the recommendations of the special committee because ""most actions of the board are in line with committee recommendations."" CME senior vice president Gerald Beyer said if the board accepts the member's petition this week, a rule change will be submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for approval. If the board does nothing, or rejects the petition request, a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership for a vote within 15 days, Beyer said. Melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on before the recommendations from the special committee are made ""it will confuse the issue."" Not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict dual trading. Although Jonathan Wolff, senior vice president at Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette, noted dual trading is evident on most exchanges. ""It's a question of the integrity of the person you do business with,"" Wolff said. Futures traders who act as brokers, however, maintain that trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in chaotic futures trading pits. ""To have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult for a broker to function because of his errors,"" said John Michael, vice president at First Options of Chicago. ""What it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved,"" he said. Furthermore, the competitive nature of futures brokerage makes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood, he said. ""If I ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running), or even suspected him of doing it, I would cut him off,"" Michael said. An average broker in the Treasury bond futures pit, for instance, will fill orders for 5,000 to 10,000 contracts a day at 1.25 dlrs per contract, floor sources said. Even figuring what is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors such brokerage can be lucrative. Front-running by brokers not only runs the market risk of an adverse price move, but also the risk of losing the brokerage business, Michael said. Reuter "

The staff of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to recommend that the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) be charged with securities fraud in connection with its July 1983 default on 2.25 billion dlrs of bonds, a WPPSS official told Reuters. WPPSS attorney Ron English said the system was advised by SEC staff attorneys that the five SEC commissioners would be asked to charge WPPSS in connection with its official statements about its plans to build its No. 3 and No. 4 nuclear power plants in the Pacific Northwest at the time it was selling the bonds. English, in a telephone interview, said the SEC staff planned to allege that WPPSS had overstated the demand for power in the region and had understated the cost of the plants, which were to built with the bonds' proceeds. English denied the allegations. He said WPPSS had made no public forecasts of power demand in connection with the bond sale and had never understated the cost of the plants.

Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts.

U.S. tin disposals should have little effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing countries to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, a government official said. The agreement by the seven-member Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) aimed to cut the world surplus and boost prices. Following the accord, ATPC Chairman Subroto appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from its strategic stockpile. ""We don't think that (the U.S. government) has a large influence in the (tin) market at this stage of the game,"" said Thomas O'Donnell, Director of International Commodities at the State Department. Last year the United States released about 4,900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms. Reuter "

The New York Mercantile Exchange set April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide. On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market, according to an exchange spokeswoman. ""This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world,"" said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman. Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained. The expanded program ""will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does,"" said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc. The rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts. Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction. Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials. When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December, NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, ""Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading.""

A bidding war for Viacom International Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a management group and other investors against National Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator. Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side. He said if outside directors approve the management proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week. ""It would take 20 days from the day we mail,"" said the source. The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by investor Sumner Redstone, would need ""half a year"" to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses and cable television franchises. Redstone was not available for comment. Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win. The independent directors of Viacom were called into a meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow. Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. ""We think we're at the end now, in terms of bidding,"" said the firm's arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified. Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock. Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash, a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share. Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs. Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered eight pct interest. Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes, were offering high prices. ""Redstone really wants to own the company,"" one said. Another said management seemed to have the edge on the timing issue. Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares. A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp FMC>, which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now just over 30 dlrs. Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs from several acquisitions affected results. Shares of Warner Communications Inc WCI> rose 7/8 to 31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25 mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at 37.50 dlrs. Chris Craft Industries CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner, rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4. Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc CBS>.

Canada's decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policy study group said ""It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period, when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world,"" the Washington-based Atlantic Council said. U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries, the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually. The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadline of October for an agreement, are the biggest issue in U.S.-Canadian relations. The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties. The council said ""in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population."" But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world. The council said that in the talks, Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports. A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized. The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending curbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and the so-called ""cultural industries"" - publishing, broadcasting and films. It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense cooperation, ""acid rain"" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage. Reuter "

""We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added businesses and continue to broaden our base,"" Henderson told reporters at an informal meeting here. ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S. drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its current pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990. Henderson said, ""Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not."" ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits. He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical division would account for about 30 pct of total company profits. ""The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate of return,"" said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, who was also at the meeting. Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one. Henderson said the major new products in the company's pipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs annually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications, Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin, a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensing agreements with Merck and Co Inc MRK>, is not expected until about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin in the U.S. later this year. Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986 income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15 billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much. Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden Paints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a unit of Hanson Industries Inc. Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40 acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that more acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as ""too expensive.""

Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro flatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek International Monetary Fund help in order to facilitate debt negotiations with commercial creditor banks. Talking to reporters, Funaro said this attitude would not help resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspended indefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external debt on February 20. Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour of European capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debt moratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improve capital flows between developed countries and third world debtor nations. Talking before his departure for Paris, he said there could be no question of Brazil adopting another IMF austerity plan after a similar package four years ago ""put Brazil in a very big recession."" ""We had an IMF program - it simply meant export more and import less. We are not going to go the IMF,"" he said. Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following his talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, saying the U.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as a problem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks. Britain also believed an IMF program would help along negotiations between Brazil and the commercial banks, the statement, which banking sources interpreted as an outright rebuttal of all Brazilian demands, said. ""That was not my impression of the meeting,"" Funaro said; ""But if the (British) answer is more or less like this, then that means nothing is helping to find a solution."" Funaro stressed that his talks in Washington last week and in Europe this week were aimed at gaining official support to unblock lending from official credit agencies, rather than to deal with Brazils ties with commercial banks. ""Since 1982, all official agencies have been closed to my country,"" he said. He said Lawson had made no commitments to support Brazil's efforts. Lawson would officially state his position when the two meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington, Funaro said. Stressing there was no binding time schedule for Brazil's debt problem to be resolved, Funaro said Brazil had not come to Europe with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis. ""We didn't come here to make a cash-flow programme,"" he said, ""We will have meetings at the IMF next month - let's see what happens."" Neither did Brazil plan a major overhaul of current domestic economic policies, which Funaro said would likely lead to a five pct economic growth this year. ""Over the past five years we paid back 45 billion dlrs and received 11 billion ... This is a very big effort,"" he said. ""What we have to offer is our cooperation."" Reuter "

All major grain producing countries must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S. wheat organizations said. The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions, ""but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions"" on world grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the two organizations said While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments. Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and ""quarantine"" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers, they said. Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said. ""We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers,"" Jim Miller, president of NAWG said.

Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he has had discussions with several American Medical International Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company. Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr takeover bid for American Medical with several large shareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass family of Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer, he said. Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage whether he had majority support. He said, however, there is support for his offer. Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc, the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical stock. Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical management and other American Medical shareholders. Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it believes a restructuring of American Medical and its business would be ""highly desirable and appropriate at this time."" ""That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of shareholders of AMI really share,"" said Pesch. Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not rule out a future takeover try. Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the Bass family. Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from Pesch. American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid. Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out. An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new Pesch offer by March 10. Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical. The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American Medical, and the company has previously said the investors support management's internal plan to improve the company's performance. The Bass family would not comment on American Medical or Pesch. Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic acquisition. Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger American Medical takeover proposal. Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall Street. However, Pesch entered his second offer with representation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group. ""I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment,"" Pesch said. Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American Medical management in place. He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to form an efficient network of hospitals. Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for American Medical. Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share. Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct loss last year. Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously. But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer. ""I think it's much more doable,"" he said. Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs. Reuter "

He was acquitted on 76 counts of willful misapplication. Burton Bongard, former Home State president, was convicted of all 81 counts willful misapplication. David Schiebel, also a former president, was convicted on three of four counts of securities violations but was acquitted on 84 charges of willful misapplication. -- corrects warner's conviction The irregularities in which the men were charged led to a state-imposed moratorium on all state-insured savings and loan companies in Ohio, which was lifted on an individual basis as the firms were able to show proof of their solvency. Judge Richard Niehaus of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court ordered Warner jailed in lieu of 3.5 mln dlrs bond.

Brazil is not happy with the existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said, adding ""This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks."" The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983, however. Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and European banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis, ""Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors,"" central bank president Francisco Gros said. Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.

For instance, if three-month LIBOR rises to 15 pct during the life of the floating-rate tranche and falls back below the 11 pct cap, investors would be paid back, dollar for dollar, the amount of interest they would have received if the CMOs did not carry a maximum interest rate, a Kidder officer said.

[u'gnp', u'trade', u'france', u'oecd']|"FRANCE HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE, OECD SAYS

French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9 pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy. The report said the French economy was ""increasingly ill-adapted to demand"" selling goods at ""uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets."" ""France's poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months,"" it said. Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986, it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to ""a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries."" This could result in further major losses of market share, particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports, it said. Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the authorities would have ""little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly,"" it added. But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said. Written mainly in December last year, the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs. ""We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost,"" one OECD official commented. OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct. The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct. But the OECD backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year, with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation. With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said. On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits. ""For the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,"" it said.

The federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp, attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said. During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE. It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.

Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing. The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE holdings were working together without disclosing their cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities laws. One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln dlr bond offering.

Last week's White House shake-up has increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to the Fed say. But they said that no decision on the appointment, which must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind. Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him. It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan. Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration, Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker, kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said. Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers, had been chosen to replace Volcker. But as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship. As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to Volcker. ""This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get,"" said one source when asked about the possibility of Volcker's reappointment. Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world. At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say. U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation, signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position. And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw ""exactly eye-to-eye"" on the dollar was seen as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman. Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983. The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a good working relationship, in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's pre-eminent economic spokesman. He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took much more seriously. But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay. ""Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay otherwise,"" said one. ""He'd have to be asked,"" said Stephen Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International. Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years. Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability. An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel. Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by his patron's departure from the White House.

European Community (EC) farm ministers were fighting hard early today to prevent a deal on cutting overflowing milk production from turning sour before trying to agree widescale reforms in other surplus sectors. Meanwhile, protests from angry European farmers over successive attempts to scale down unwanted Community food production appeared to be gathering strength. In the northeastern Spanish city of Saragossa thousands of Spanish farmers battled with police during a march to demand a better deal from Brussels. The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets and occupied local government buildings while in the southern city of Malaga, citrus growers dumped more 20 tonnes of lemons on the streets in protest at EC duties. Towards the end of last week, about 10,000 angry West German farmers marched through the streets of Hanover burning effigies of Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle while in France pig-farmers barricaded roads in protest at falling prices. Europe's 12 mln farmers are furious over plans by the European Commission to cut subsidised prices and severely limit farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted food into public stores at high guaranteed EC prices. In the toughest-ever proposals for the annual price review, at which EC ministers set the levels of subsidies, Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen has included measures that could result in price cuts for some products of up to 11 pct. The plans form part of an on-going campaign to reform surplus-creating farm policies that have become a political embarrassment at home and commercial flash-point abroad and threatened to leave the Community with no cash for other areas. Andriessen's latest package comes only months after a decision to cut dairy production by 9.5 pct over two years and to slash beef prices by around 10 pct. That decision, agreed in outline last December after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations, was hailed as the most significant step yet in the reform offensive, but has since run into difficulties over the fine print. West Germany and Ireland are objecting to the new rules governing the sales of surplus butter into cold stores, but the Commission is loathe to abandon its position as the accord has been used as the inspiration for Andriessen's latest package. Ministers failed yesterday to overcome the problem, and resumed negotiations in a bid to finalise the details before starting the price review which is confidently predicted to last many months. EC farm spending currently swallows two thirds of an overall annual budget of around 40 billion dlrs and is almost entirely blamed for a projected budget shortfall later this year of some 5.7 billion dlrs.

Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier. Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people, up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier.

The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid, he said in a statement. He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire. Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system. ""The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,"" he said.

The failure of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said. Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said. A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss quotas was set, delegates said. Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil. With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted. Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring, coffee dealers said. The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks. Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council adjourned, ""A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria. ""We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their political influence in the ICO."" Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster countered, ""Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas, not negotiate them."" Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme. But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's share to 28.8 pct. Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it. A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together. Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems, illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings. Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure to agree quotas, analysts said. The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates forecast. The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full council is not due to meet again until September, delegates said. REUTER "

No casualties have been reported and no further major damage, civil defence sources said. Twenty-five people were treated for bone fractures after yesterday's shock. A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes. Today's quakes were felt over an area of 100 square km, the seismologist added. A state of civil defence emergency in the area was declared yesterday and is still in force, with schools closed and access to the worst-hit towns of Edgecumbe, Whakatane and the forestry town of Kawerau severely restricted. Yesterday's quake measured 6.25 on the Richter scale.

Japanese investor interest in British gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, and on calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said. Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said. Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger, the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said.

Japan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953. ""There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment,"" said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions. ""At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving,"" a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports. Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned.

He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency. The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level. The federation said in its request that many local textile exporters were operating without profit and would go out of business if the rate continued to fall.

U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement.

Thailand's improving economy will likely cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at end-February, private bankers said. Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier. Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the Bangkok Bank Ltd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relatively high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market, and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan, contributed to the projected sharp rise. Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said. A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985. Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached. Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold, special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target is equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports. REUTER "

[u'singapore']|"NEUTRAL BUDGET EXPECTED IN SINGAPORE

Singapore's Finance Minister Richard Hu is expected to announce a neutral budget tomorrow with no major tax changes for the 1987/88 year starting April 1, bankers and economists told Reuters. They said with real growth at an estimated 1.9 pct in calendar 1986, indicating signs of recovery from the 1.7 pct shrinkage in 1985, the government was likely to hold its course and wait for measures introduced in last year's budget to work. Last March Hu cut corporation tax to 33 pct from 40 pct, and income tax was reduced by the same margin. Last year the government also reduced wage costs by introducing a wage freeze and cutting employer contributions to the mandatory state savings scheme, the Central Provident Fund (CPF), to 15 pct of salaries from 25 pct. ""I don't foresee any new or additional stimulus because the economy is now improving,"" said Clemente Escano, vice president of the Union Bank of Switzerland. The government's economic report for calendar 1986, issued last week, said the CPF reduction and other cost-cutting measures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986. But the report said over half the economy -- especially the commerce, financial, and business services sectors -- continued to be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regional economies and an excess of domestic property. The sources said the fragility of the economic recovery suggested the government would not introduce much of its planned consumption tax in the coming financial year. In last year's budget Hu said he planned to set up collecting machinery for the tax. Economists said a campaign against smoking this year might be the opportunity for him to levy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use. The sources said the government does not look likely to raise more revenue in this year's budget. Last year's budget projected a 3.22 billion dlr budget deficit for fiscal 1986/87, but the economic report projected an overall calendar 1986 surplus of three billion. Lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment income and stringent controls on government operating expenditure, helped by the wage-freeze policy. Anthony K.P. Lee, vice-president and deputy general manager of American Express Bank Ltd, said he expected nothing exciting from this year's budget. Lee said, ""It will probably be a non-event as most of the tax benefits were given last year. The economy has already started moving so it does not need government support."" Last week's economic report attributed the one pct decline in domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline in private construction, so this sector hopes for some relief from the budget, economists said. The economic report said the sector's activity declined by 25.3 pct in calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985. A further decline is expected in 1987. But in last year's budget a 30 pct rebate on tax for industrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct until the end of 1988, so the most Hu is likely to do is add incentives for creating property investment unit trusts. The only measures known to be in tomorrow's budget are incentives to encourage population growth, including incentives to families who have three children. Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has already announced the government will try to encourage three-child families, instead of the two-child families it encourages now. REUTER "

Fisons Plc FISN.L> said strong international growth had been the main feature of the group's 1986 progress, with the pharmaceutical division reporting a 50 pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period. The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme, a larger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form of its Intal anti-asthma drug, which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct. The company was commenting on 1986 results which saw pre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985. The result was in line with market forecasts, but its shares nevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from 643p. Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral, as well as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products, was clearly indicated by a strong 1986 performance.

The Philippines must devalue the peso if it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.

It is currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions. Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance. ""If the dollar rate goes higher, our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the financing is very difficult,"" she said. ""But I am looking at it in terms of the economy."" She said she was not trying to oppose official policy. ""I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead."" Monsod said, ""The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates) of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic thing."" Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year. He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.

The Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan released its proposal for early creation of a comprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo.

It should provide currency and interest rate futures, and incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock index futures contracts. The proposal said transactions in all these contracts must be conducted on the same market so participants can readily engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments. To make this possible, the proposal calls for new legislation which would administer all related futures and options transactions under the same legal framework. Banking sources said they expect that initially the currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would include Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit, three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki as saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible because it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan's financial markets.

Japan looks likely to allow U.S. Banks to conduct securities business here, a move that will probably cause the barriers separating Japanese commercial banks from brokerage houses to break down, financial analysts said. But the timing of the approval remains uncertain, due to conflicting domestic interests. J.P.Morgan and Co JPM>, Bankers Trust New York Corp BT>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp MHC> and Chemical Bank New York Corp CHL> are expected to win approval to conduct securities business in Japan, U.S. Bank officials said. ""There is no reason for extended delay of approval,"" one official at a U.S. Bank said. The four U.S. Banks have been seeking finance ministry approval for months. To date, Japan has allowed European banks to do securities business here through 50-pct owned subsidiaries. As Japanese banks can conduct securities business in European countries, this was seen as a reciprocal move and did not pave the way for Japanese banks to enter the domestic securities market. But if U.S. Banks win approval, Japanese banks will press hard for similiar status, since they are not allowed to conduct securities business in the U.S. Many U.S. Bank officials expect their applications to be approved before June. But Japanese banking sources said the decision will be delayed until next year. A spokesman for the finance ministry declined comment. U.S. Bankers will meet with ministry officials for talks on financial market deregulation sometime in the next few months. Ministry sources said the talks are likely to be held in April or June. At the last round of financial negotiations in September, U.S. Officials said Japan's commitment to deregulation was flagging. Analysts said the finance ministry has been seriously considering the U.S. Request since the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York approved five new primary government securities dealers, including two Japanese brokerages, last December. They said the ministry will have to approve the U.S. Request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open to foreigners as those of the U.S. Analysts said Japan has proceeded rapidly with financial deregulation since 1984, but has not touched upon the clear division between the securities and banking businesses. Japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard to protect their interests, but analysts said the banks are finding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditional fields. Officials of major Japanese banks said they will pay special attention to the ministry's reaction to U.S. Bank requests because approval would accelerate market liberalization in Japan.

CRA Ltd CRAA.S> said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1, making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985. The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln. CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been pid. The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement. Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout, it said. Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of gold producers. Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said. Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said. World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance, but overcapacity continues, CRA said. Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd's CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.

Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985, CRA said. Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln. CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985. CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard. Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions, CRA said. Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.

[u'trade', u'china', u'usa', u'gatt']|"CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.

China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. ""It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports,"" the editorial said. ""The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP). ""Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries,"" it added The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that ""all kinds of difficulties and restrictions"" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. The paper also printed a table showing that, since bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin. He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status. The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP, China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and ""not be dominated or controlled by international Communism."" The official said China was well aware of the laws, some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them. China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years, which the U.S. Side won, he said. But, for the first time, China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added. Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT. ""China has the potential to disrupt world markets, especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT,"" the diplomat said. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China's interest in participating in GATT. ""The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type,"" Shultz said. ""China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation,"" he said. The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially for exports, and a de facto dual currency system. In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with ""guidance planning"" and economic levers. The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to do. REUTER "

Britain's gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a 72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said. The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of borrowings and repayments. This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise. The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest. Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26 billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.

West German banks would like Brazil to work more closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with a view to seeking a solution to the country's debt problems, senior West German banking sources said. The sources, speaking ahead of a meeting later today between Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and his West german counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg, also believed Brazil should come up with a convincing economic recovery program. Their comments echoed those of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who met Funaro yesterday. Funaro is currently on a European trip seeking to involve governments in negotiations with commercial banks on rescheduling part of Brazil's foreign debt, which totals some 109 billion dlrs. But Lawson told Funaro Brazil had to solve its problems with the banks rather than governments. Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Funaro would leave early tomorrow morning for Zurich after meeting Stoltenberg this evening. Funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with the IMF and said there is no question of Brazil agreeing to an austerity program with the Fund. However, the West German banking sources said institutions here felt it was particularly important that Brazil presented a credible recovery program and that there be a ""rapprochement"" with the IMF. ""Consultations are the least that can be expected,"" said one banker. Funaro's trip follows the decision by Brazil 10 days ago to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. It has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs. One senior banker closely involved in Brazilian debt negotiation offered qualified support for a call from Funaro for a change in the structure of the advisory committee of banks which has coordinated Brazilian debt since 1982. Funaro said yesterday that U.S. Banks, holding 35 pct of Brazilian debt, were over-represented on the 14-bank advisory committee with 50 pct of the committee seats. He said Brazil might adopt a different approach to its creditor banks, involving separate discussions with the regions. Such a move would be in Brazil's interest, since European banks have been more supportive than U.S. Banks of alternative debt solutions, such as interest capitalisation. The senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regional approach, saying: ""There must be one committee and one solution."" But he added: ""There must be an understanding that special requests from special regions be taken into account."" German banks had objected to the fact that the idea of interest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. It was imperative that alternative options be considered. ""The menu must become richer,"" the banker said. Banking sources said commercial banks would not be involved in today's talks with Funaro. A spokesman for the Bundesbank in Frankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented. West German banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to the Brazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions in the United States, because of their lower exposure. According to Bundesbank data from September last year, West German bank exposure to Latin America of slightly under 16 billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreign credit. REUTER "

Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. Reuter "

[u'uk', u'japan']|"JAPANESE DEMAND FOR U.K. GILTS SEEN RISING

Japanese investor interest in British gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, and on calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said. Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said. Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger, the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said. On the other hand, major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year, traders said. These investors, who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a British securities house said. The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from 234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year. Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit from further declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said. ""The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds, suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here,"" said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki. She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct, against 9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London. REUTER "

Daimler-Benz AG [DAIG.F] said its car production could fall by 150 cars a day in the foreseeable future if works councils continue to refuse to approve the firm's requests for employees to work overtime when necessary. A company spokesman said the works council at Daimler's Unterturkheim plant, which makes axles and other components for Daimler cars, has withheld approval for overtime since the beginning of the month. The IG Metall metalworkers union in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has called on works councils in the state to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employ more workers. The Daimler spokesman said the lack of overtime work at the Unterturkheim plant could eventually affect car output at other plants but added he was unable to say when this might occur. A spokesman for Dr.-Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG [PSHG.F], which is also located in Baden-Wuerttemberg, said he did not think Porsche would suffer any loss of production because of a ban on overtime by its own works councils. A strike by IG Metall in Baden-Wuerttemberg in 1984 closed down the German car industry for about seven weeks as the union sought to win a 35-hour working week for its members. It later settled for a reduction in the working week to 38.5 hours. The spokesman said Daimler's total output of cars was currently around 2,500 a day. REUTER "

Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.

Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board. A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far.

[u'usa', u'volcker', u'james-baker']|"REGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY

Last week's White House shake-up has increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to the Fed say. But they said that no decision on the appointment, which must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind. Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him. It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan. Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration, Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker, kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said. Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers, had been chosen to replace Volcker. But as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship. As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to Volcker. ""This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get,"" said one source when asked about the possibility of Volcker's reappointment. Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world. At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say. U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation, signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position. And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw ""exactly eye-to-eye"" on the dollar was seen as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman. Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983. The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a good working relationship, in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's pre-eminent economic spokesman. He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took much more seriously. But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay. ""Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay otherwise,"" said one. ""He'd have to be asked,"" said Stephen Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International. Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years. Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability. An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel. Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by his patron's departure from the White House.

This morning's sharp decline in coffee prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said. ""The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again,"" a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said. ""The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present, there is a shortage of quality,"" he said.

Unilever Plc UN.A> and NV group reported improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said. He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years. Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he noted. But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic acquisitions taking place ""from time to time,"" he said. The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion. Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution. However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs. Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987. The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with the change in attributable profit. Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said that there was no target date for completing the process. He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which operates outside Unilever's core activities. In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business, considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.

The Kenyan economy is heading for difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said. In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985. The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985, he added. ""But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year,"" he said. The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986. Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs. Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more difficult to finance the government's budget deficit. Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history, he added.

The company said information management products will be the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business communications campaign under the threme ""The New Vision of Kodak."" Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company, Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four billion dlrs in 1986. ""If the Kodak divisions generating those sales were independent, that company would rank among the top 100 of the Fortune 500,"" it pointed out. The objective of Kodak's ""new vision"" communications campaign, it added, is to inform others of the company's commitment to the business and industrial sector. Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the information management systems unveilded today -- -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes). - The Kodak KIMS system 5000, a networked information management system using optical disks or microfilm or both. -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000, an optical-disk-based system that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current information management systems. -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500, a microfilm-based, computer-assisted system which can be a starter system. Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a write-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in 1988. Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up to 150, 14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes of randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus, Kodak pointed out, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity. Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000 in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies, including erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media, fiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected to sell in the 700,000 dlr range. Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk version which provides data storage and retrieval through a disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing 2.6 gigabytes. Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of the family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually loaded optical disk drives, it will sell for about 150,000 dlrs with deliveries beginning in mid-year. The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with the more powerful KIMS system 5000. It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and software as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987 and sell in the 150,000 dlr range. Reuter "

""The low dollar makes our prices very attractive,"" he said at a GM preview before the opening of the Geneva Motor Show. ""We would like to sell between 7,000 and 8,000 units in Europe for the year to August 1987,"" he told Reuters later. Officials said GM sold 1,500 vehicles in the 1986 model year. Fry said that at an average price of 13,000 dlrs, his projected sales figures would mean turnover of between 91 mln and 104 mln dlrs in Europe. GM sales in Europe in the 1985 model year totalled 500 vehicles, due largely to uncompetitive prices because of the then strong dollar, Fry said. All GM vehicles sold in Europe are manufactured in the United States and Canada, he said, adding that most sales were in Switzerland followed by Sweden and West Germany. Reuter "

There was no evidence of winterkill in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S. Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field report. The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall because of dry conditions. However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on last fall's late seeding, it said. Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the report said. Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage under these conditions, they said.

Ford Motor Co of Canada Ltd, 90 pct owned by Ford Motor Co F>, said the earlier reported decline in full year net profit was mainly due to changeoover costs at its Essex, Ontario engine plant. Ford Canada also said sharply improved fourth quarter results were due to improved cost recovery and lower product program costs, partially offset by lower engine production. The company earlier said consolidated 1986 net income fell to 101.9 mln dlrs from year-ago 199.0 mln dlrs. Fourth quarter profit improved to 67.7 mln dlrs from 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior year. Ford Canada said full-year earnings from its Canadian operations declined 75.4 mln dlrs to 104.0, while fourth quarter profit increased to 49.1 mln dlrs from 16.1 mln dlrs in the prior year. Ford Canada reported a full year loss of 2.9 mln dlrs from its overseas operations, compared to a 19.6 mln dlr profit in 1985. Fourth quarter earnings from overseas operations rose to 18.6 mln dlrs from a loss of 11.6 mln dlrs in the prior year. The company reported full-year domestic sales in Canada of 4.35 billion dlrs compared to 3.95 billion dlrs in 1985, excluding export sales to its U.S. parent. Ford Canada said it had 1986 export sales to its parent company of 7.97 billion dlrs, up from year-earlier 7.18 billion dlrs. The company reported 1986 overseas sales fell 205.7 mln dlrs to 2.01 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion dlrs in 1985. The company attributed the improvement in fourth quarter results from overseas operations to manufacturing efficiencies, cost reduction programs and improved cost recovery, which were partially offset by lower industry volumes. Ford Canada's net loss for the year from overseas operations resulted from lower industry volumes and increased interest costs, the company said. Despite increased competition, Ford Canada's market share of car sales rose to 17.2 pct from 17.0 pct in 1985, it said. The company's share of industry truck sales rose to 29.7 pct in 1986 from year-earlier 29.2 pct. Ford Canada said sales were boosted by its Ford Tempo car and Ford light truck, both manufactured in Oakville, which were Canada's best selling car and truck nameplates in 1986. Reuter "
[u'usa']|"FIRESTONE FIR> TO CLOSE THREE TIRE PLANTS

Firestone Tire and Rubber Co has notified the United Rubber Workers the company will close its Des Moines, Iowa, Bloomington, Ill., and Oklahoma City tire plants on or before September 15. A Firestone spokesman said the cost of the closings will be covered by the 65 mln dlrs restructuring charge the company took in the fourth quarter of 1986. The company said it was notified by the union March one that the agreement reached with Local 998 at the Oklahoma City tire plant had been rejected by union members at the other plants. Firestone said it has been discussing the possible sale of its Des Moines and Bloomington plants with prospective buyers for several months. Those discussions are continuing, the company said, adding it could not predict their outcome. Firestone is willing to work with any organization wishing to consider the purchase of the three tire plants, it added. Last October, Firestone advised the union the tire plants in Des Moines, Bloomington and Oklahoma City were being designated as ""distressed"" under the terms of its master agreement with the rubber workers. Firestone said it has twice reached agreement with the leadership and members of the local in Oklahoma City on plans to reduce operating costs through revisions in wages, benefits and work rules. Union procedures, however, require approval by the Firestone section of the union's International Policy Committee, membrs of other locals covered by the master contract and by the rubber workers' executive board. The company said the rejection of the Oklahoma City package by union locals at Des Moines and other locations and the limited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural and off-the-road tires in North America led Firestone to conclude the parties would be unable to reach agreements that would permit the continued operation of the Des Moines and Bloomington plants.

Venezuela will limit new loans to 50 pct of the interest and principal it repays on its 31 billion dlr foreign debt, President Jaime Lusinchi told political leaders. Speaking last night at a new session of congress, he said last week's agreement to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in public sector foreign debt at lower interest rates reflected Venezuela's improved credit image. ""Our priority is development, but I insist that there cannot be development if we don't fulfil our obligations,"" he said. Venezuela agreed last Friday with its 13-bank advisory committee to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over libor from 1-1/8 and reduce amortisations in the next three years to 1.35 billion dlrs from 3.35 billion. ""The important thing is that this rate of 7/8 pct is a marker for new negotiations and will save us 50 mln dlrs this year,"" Lusinchi said. He said the country had been loyal to the principles of the Cartagena group of Latin American debtors but had ""decided to reach an agreement convinced that Venezuela is a specal case, because of the vulnerability of its economy."" Venezuela signed a 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord in February, 1986, but immediately sought new terms because of falling oil income, which dropped 40 pct last year. Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters he hopes to sign the new rescheduling accord early in the second quarter, but that in any case it would become effective from April 1. Azpurua said Venezuela's 450 or so creditor banks have been contacted with details of the new agreement, and that Public Finances Director Jorge Marcano may visit financial centres to round up support. Azpurua said that among the details still to be finalised were the exact timetable for reprogrammed payments and the outlines of a government plan to allow public and private sector debt capitalisation. He said banks had shown willingness to consider new loans to Venezuela, a fundamental achievement in the new accord. ""Substantial progress has been made in talks and we will now have to define more precisely what projects can be financed from foreign borrowing,"" he said, adding that loans for steel and aluminium and iron ore sectors could be the first to materialise.

The London Stock Exchange's traded options market plans volume growth of at least 80 pct a year, and will more than double the range of options available by the end of 1988, options committee chairman Geoffrey Chamberlain said. He told a news conference that more options contracts were traded in 1986 than in the previous seven years of the market's existence. Chamberlain said the daily average volume of contracts traded in February this year almost tripled to 53,056 from 19,034 in the same month last year, and further rapid growth was expected. ""We're aiming for 100 stock option classes by the end of 1988,"" said Chamberlain. These would correspond to the eligible constituents of the FT-SE 100 share index. Chamberlain added that two new equity options were to be introduced this month. Options will be available in Sears Plc SEHL.L> from March 4, and in Plessey Co. Plc PLYL.L> from March 19. The London Stock Exchange is the largest outside the United States for options trading. Forty-five equity options, two currency options, two government bond (gilt) options and an option on the FTSE-100 index are available at present. Chamberlain said the Stock Exchange aimed to consolidate the London options market's leading position in Europe, especially important with French and Swiss equity options trading planned to start this year. ""I'd go so far as to say the plans for growth are conservative,"" one leading options analyst said, predicting continuing volume growth of around 20 pct a month for at least the next year. He said much of the recent growth in options had come from inter-market-maker trading aimed at hedging book positions. But now the retail options market was beginning to take off. The market trades from a corner of the now largely deserted floor of the London Stock Exchange. The floor has been left almost empty in the wake of the recent regulatory changes in the equity and gilts (government bond) markets, which have encouraged a move to electronic off-floor trading. Yesterday, the Stock Exchange decided to close the floor to equities trading altogether, and said it expected to make a final decision on the floor's future by the end of 1987. The floor space could be used for a purpose-built options market, but Chamberlain said that it was unlikely that the options market would need more than half of the available space. REUTER "

Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a 19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to report improved results in future earnings periods. ""Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income, highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the periods ahead,"" chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement. The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year ago. Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities. The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103 mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs from 42 mln dlrs last year. Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago. Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said. The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to 98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages. Reuter "

Coffee producing countries must quickly map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private coffee exporters' association, said. Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices. An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil. Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet.

The 1987 outlook for U.S. auto sales is clouded by a decidedly mixed sales forecast, and analysts who follow the industry say it is also true for companies that sell parts and equipment to the major car and truck manufacturers. But while there are only four major U.S.-based automakers whose shares are traded on stock exchanges, there are thousands of big and small suppliers who sell a flood of original and replacement parts. Analysts who follow the parts industry say there are many opportunities for investors brought on by the auto industry's intensified competition and the large volume of production in North America planned by Japanese automakers. But assessing the supplier arena is far more complicated than for investors considering the stocks of the Detroit Big Three - General Motors Corp GM>, Ford Motor Co F> and Chrysler Corp C>.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support. He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget.

The deal AMR Corp cut to buy 40 new planes is a plus for the company because it clearly puts the financial burden on aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co BA> and Airbus Industrie>, a European consortium, analysts said. ""The terms put most of the risk on the shoulders of the manufacturers,"" said analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley and Co. ""They're called walkaway leases."" AMR agreed to buy 15 planes from Boeing and 25 from Airbus but said its American Airlines unit will lease the aircraft, which essentially will be owned by the manufacturers. AMR declined to value the deal, which analysts estimated at roughly 2.4 billion dlrs. American Airlines will use the planes, scheduled for delivery in 1988 and 1989, to expand its service in the Caribbean and to Europe. But AMR will not lay out cash deposits to pay for the planes, nor will it take on new debt to finance the purchases. The carrier has 20-year leases on the aircraft, with four-year extension options, and may cancel the leases with 30 days notice by paying a small penalty, according to AMR chairman Robert Crandall. ""We're getting the aircraft on very favorable terms,"" Crandall told a press briefing here. He called the deals ""off balance sheet"" limited obligation leases, under which the financing is provided by the manufacturers. A spokesman for Airbus confirmed those terms. ""We will own the aircraft and they will be leasing them from us,"" he said. Airbus is providing American Airlines with 25 of its twin-jet, long-range A300-600 planes. A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Co, the unit of Boeing that makes the long-range 767-300 planes that are part of the deal, declined to comment on financing arrangements. Analysts said ""walkaway lease"" deals have been used before by airlines buying aircraft, particularly new generations of planes, but not to this extent. Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc said the deal will give AMR financial stability as it grows. ""AMR is using the manufacturers' balance sheets to finance these airplanes and consequently, its debt to equity ratio will remain stable into the early 1990s,"" he said. ""The deal reflects a fundamental trend where airlines will increasingly become operators of assets rather than owners"" to reduce their exposure to risk, he added. Reuter "

One of General Electric Co's biggest businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs, Wall Street analysts said. Previously, it was expected the business would peak and decline at some point in the next five years. The improved outlook results from AMR Corp's AMR> decision to order 40 new planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines. ""Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order,"" said Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements for its order of 15 Boeing Co BA> and 25 Airbus Industrie> twinjet long distance aircraft. But AMR said it was using ""rent-a-plane leases"" that allow it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe downturn in the economy. From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal for several reasons, Heymann said. GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of delivery, Heymann noted. And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc, would have little trouble rounding up another airline that wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said. GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company ""no one order will have much of an effect on the stock."" Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the order ""will help to maintain a good level of production and profitability in the aircraft engine business"" for GE. Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs by 1991. Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last year, with well over half of the business in the military sector, according to analysts' estimates. The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides with an upbeat performance in other segments. Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results, he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp that it has a ""unique ability"" to buy a major business and reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other elements of its 14 business areas. Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates. Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part crediting ""significant benefits from the RCA acquisition."" Reuter "

It said the bodies were made on presses used for Bertone's steel-structured sports cars. Alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested in Britain by the Motor Industry Research Association. Alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminum structure technology so that it is suitable for modern auto making methods and plants. Alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of a car's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling and performance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. It said the structures also provide long life without the need for rust protection. The structure provides the same stiffness and safety as present materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65 pct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said. Reuter "

The specialty retailing area continues to pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct. It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years ago. Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared with the prior year's 5.96 billion. For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose 10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with 1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share. Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs. Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that income generated by the company's specialty store operations accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits. He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650 more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said. Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies, which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700 Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of which 1,200 are in the United States. Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth, said in a statement, ""These results are especially gratifying as they are an improvement over last year's record earnings."" Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier period. Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the 1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam, a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United States, although Woolco still operates in Canada. In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time, the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores. Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot than general merchandise stores. Reuter "

Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford said he prefers debt conversion plans to help heavily indebted countries over quick-fix political plans to help ease their debt burden. ""In my view, debt conversions or swaps into either equity or local debt claims provide a preferable route to 'debt relief' for the debtor nations, particularly if combined with measures to encourage new equity investment and the repatriation of flight capital,"" he told the House Subcommittee on International Development Institutions. Mulford criticized what he called large-scale solutions to the debt problems effecting many developing countries, ranging from debt forgiveness to creating new multilateral institutions for lending. ""While such approaches may have some political appeal, they are impractical and ultimately counterproductive,"" he said. He said debt conversions, or swaps, are more effective because they eliminate the interest service on converted debt, create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that can help indebted countries overcome their own problems.

Canadian economic growth is expected to slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should keep the country from recession, economists said. ""The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth over the course of 1987,"" said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd. Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product, grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion, but down from 1985's four pct. In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter. ""Essentially it is a flat performance,"" said Warren Jestin, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia. Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc said ""it shows the economy is not moving along very steadily, it's not a very promising number."" ""We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession,"" she added. The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last month. He also projected the economy would expand 2.8 pct this year. Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range. Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs. ""The sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,"" the federal agency said in a statement. The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985. But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S. economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and help fuel the country's modest expansion.

[u'uk']|"BANK OF ENGLAND PROPOSES LIMITS ON UNDERWRITERS

The Bank of England proposed that banks in Britain for the first time will have to seek authorization to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets. In addition, the Bank has proposed limits on the amount of credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they lead manage. The proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and deposit takers and may be modified, the Bank said. The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond securities issued each year. In 1986, about 183 billion dlrs of new eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine. Up until now, there have been no restrictions on lead managing eurobond issues. However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank of England is concerned about intense competition for market share which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to imprudent credit risk. Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as banks compete to offer the best terms. But the new rules suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk than it can handle. Banking sources said that while the Bank of England is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing to accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters act prudently. ""The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank's lead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill and experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market concerned...,"" the Bank's proposal said. Once a firm has received permission to act as lead underwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of the face amount of the securities. Nominal exposure exceeding 60 pct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and it must be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct of capital. The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of 28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. After that, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be assessed at their full face value. The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities, revolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said. The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen its supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which called for comments from professionals by March 31 to allow their possible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its planned final discussion in Parliament, scheduled before summer. The new Banking Bill, updating the 1979 Banking Act, is the third leg of the Conservative government's legislation for the supervision of financial institutions. It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act, aimed to bolster investor protection, and the Building Societies Act, which put these institutions on an equal footing with banks. The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between recognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legal controls, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors. Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England in advance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of their capital, and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10 and 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed. However, preliminary consultations with bank representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be flawed, it said. Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a case-by-case basis rather than along general lines. Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment of exposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other units of their own group of companies, the paper showed. They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to local governments and other public sector entities, and of exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks. Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as collateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed. Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their own group of companies would usually be looked into on a case-by-case basis under new proposals, it said. The paper said exposures to state-owned industries and other public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad should be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees. It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities and those guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee Department would probably not qualify for such treatment. On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of another bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceiling could be exceeded in individual cases. But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking to take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and state in writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary's balance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said. On collateral security, it said this ""should normally only be taken into account when considering the acceptability of a bank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base."" ""The presence of security taken on its own will be considered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure in excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptional circumstances and even then to a very limited extent,"" it said.

Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said. Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said. But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said. ""From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year),"" Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said. The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said. ""Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us,"" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said. The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said. With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination. ""Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness,"" Martell said. Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said. Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said. Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said. ""The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now,"" a USDA official said. But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said. Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said. ""A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half,"" Martell said. Reuter "

Crude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices, analysts said. ""The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting,"" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ""But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,"" he added. Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december. The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week. The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said. ""They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales,"" Margoshes said. He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales. Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts. Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart. Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, ""both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally."" He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions. Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market. Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments. North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr. OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions. Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level. ""The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result,"" Margoshes said. Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount. But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short. Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986.

Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said. The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close. The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb. Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said. The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop. In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. ""If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried,"" Dauster said, adding ""now it is time to go and sell coffee."" But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market last year. A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market ""in one go"" but is sold over a minimum of six months. The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said ""objective criteria"" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said. All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ""ad hoc"" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO. Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. It is a ""simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate"" policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different ""objective criteria"" achieve different share-outs of quota, Dauster said. Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them. ""We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage,"" one delegate said. Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed. The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September. More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability. In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found. ""Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now,"" one consumer said. Reuter "

General Motors Corp said its directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 pct of its 1.66 dlr par value common stock by the end of 1990. GM said the level of repurchases this year will not exceed 10 mln shares or about three pct of its outstanding stock.

[u'usa', u'brazil']|"U.S. OFFICIALS SAY BRAZIL SHOULD DEAL WITH BANKS

The U.S. is sticking for the moment to its policy that Brazil, which two weeks ago suspended debt payments to private banks, should deal with its creditors and not with governments, U.S. officials said. ""I don't see any desire here to scurry around and help Brazil until we get a better sense of what they are trying to do,"" a senior administration official stated. ""Brazil has to do business through the banks at this point,"" said another official following an assessment of that country's latest debt crisis. The official, who asked that his name not be used, said the National Security Council, the Treasury and State departments and other agencies held a meeting yesterday to discuss the situation. In a related development, small regional banks that have made loans to Brazil and other heavily-indebted Latin American countries, will meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker here tomorrow. Brazil, with about 108 billion dlrs in debt, shocked banks late last month when it stopped interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to them until it can work out its problems. Brazil's trade surplus, its main source of foreign exchange has dwindled in recent months, making it difficult to service its debt. The official said the interagency meeting was called to discuss ""the general debt situation and compare notes on (Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro."" Funaro, who told reporters here that he wanted a political discussion with industrialized nations on Brazil's debt problems in an effort to obtain more and faster lending from official sources, held discussions here on Friday with Volcker, Treasury Secretary James Baker and other officials. Another senior administration official said he was perplexed by Funaro's decision to discuss the latest crisis with governments and not with creditor banks, at a time when Brazil is in danger of losing short-term credit lines. ""We are not clear at all on his tactics. To me it seems bizarre, just bizarre,"" the official said. One official today described Funaro's argument as ""nonsense,"" and said there had been a considerable flow of funds to Brazil, for which that country was in arrears. Funaro has said Brazil acted to protect its reserves but wanted to avoid a confrontation. The consensus among administration officials seems to be that Brazil's latest debt crisis is the result of the domestic economic problems. ""Brazil is a special case, but there's no doubt they would not be in the mess they're in if they had not screwed-up their economic policy,"" a senior official added. Several of the regional banks that will meet with Volcker tomorrow declined to comment because the talks will be held at the Fed's suggestion. ""Since they are the hosts, we feel it's up to them if they want to say something,"" one regional bank official said. But other banking sources said that regional banks, many of which are refusing to continue lending to Latin America, are dissatisfied with decisions of major banks such as Citibank, in the refinancing of foreign debts. The sources added that Volcker, for his part, is dissatisfied with some major banks' refusal to make interest rate concessions to Brazil and other Latin American debtors, and would like to see smaller creditor banks take a more actve role in the rescheduling process.

Total supply of frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly above year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown sharp gains to date. The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be affected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, on whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S. have caused injury. Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier. The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm. In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm. During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said. Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remaining suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a consequence prices have strengthened, the department said. Reuter "

Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat whose committee is in charge of tax legislation, met this afternoon with House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, to discuss a variety of tax and budget issues, an aide said. He added that Wright did not endorse the securities transfer tax but raised it yesterday as a possible way to cut the federal deficit. The aide to Wright added that Wright asked the Ways and Means Committee to look into the securities transfer tax.

Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S. corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs. Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit control act of 1985, it said. Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said. The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments. Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year -- September-January. National weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and 1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the 3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.

The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law, the department said. Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the department said.

Liedtke, in a letter mailed today to Pennzoil shareholders, said Texaco's management has incorrectly implied in recent public statements that Pennzoil was not interested in settling the case. ""Pennzoil has made Texaco several proposals, both before and after trial, to settle this dispute,"" Liedtke said in the letter. ""We do not know why Texaco's officials would now make such clearly untrue statements."" Last month, a Texas state appeals court upheld a jury judgment that Texaco illegally interfered with Pennzoil's plan to acquire Getty Oil in 1983. The appeals court reduced by two billion dlrs the original 10.53 billion dlrs in damages awarded to Pennzoil, but interest accruing on the award has pushed the total amount back above 10 billion dlrs. Pennzoil said that Texaco had made four unsatisfactory proposals to settle the billion-dollar lawsuit. ""Other than to put on the record that it has made offers, Texaco's proposals make no sense,"" Liedtke said in the letter. ""In fact, two of Texaco's offers were identical and were proposals that Texaco knew in advance Pennzoil would not accept."" The letter did not disclose terms of settlement offers made by either Pennzoil or Texaco. ""If and when Texaco's management changes its position and demonstrates a willingness to make a good faith attempt to settle this matter, Pennzoil will make every effort to cooperate,"" Liedtke said. ""Such a solution, I believe, is clearly in the interests of both companies, even if it not attractive, as a personal matter, to Texaco's management and directors.""

Barron Hilton, Conrad's son, is making a bid to purchase those 6,782,000 shares, the company said. However, in an effort to hold onto the stock, the Foundation changed its tax status from a private foundation to a public support organization, freeing it from the constraints of the excess business holdings limitations imposed on private foundations by the Tax Reform Act of 1969, according to the Hilton Corp. That act said that a private foundation could not own more than 20 pct of a corporation, lawyers explained. Anything over that figure had to be sold. The lawyers explained that when Conrad Hilton died, the law required that excess holdings by the Foundation above 20 pct of the common stock should be sold. Under Conrad Hilton's will, Barron had the option to buy the seven pct, according to the Hilton lawyers. Now Hilton lawyers contend that through a clause in the tax law, Barron Hilton is entitled to buy the entire 27 pct block of stock.

The Australian Government will likely reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.) dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne. For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5 mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the breakeven export price, it said. Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the department said. In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives. But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90. The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports, the department said. Reuter "

Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer. Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong. ""Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down,"" Wellemeyer said. ""The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a barrel) and are willing to make it happen again,"" he said. In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output. Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993. Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the world demand for oil. Reuter "

The European Community, EC, sold 75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85 and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains. EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season, it said. The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year. The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production, and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said. It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets. Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low. Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees. With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal, traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances. An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop, means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized, traders said. Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the more attractive deal from the government, they added. Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton. One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans, which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

Wall Street analysts said the GM buyback will boost the shares in the near term but some had reservations about the long term effects of the plan. ""They're trying to soothe irate shareholders irriated by the buyout of Ross Perot,"" said analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Healy said General Motors chairman Roger Smith had been hinting at a buyback program in meetings with institutional investors. He said the plan, which could cost more than five billion dlrs over four years, was similar in size to Ford Motor Co's F> repurchase program but smaller on a percentage basis than that of Chrysler Corp C>. Healy said General Motors will have to borrow money to buy back stock on a large scale. The General Motors plan, announced after a board of directors meeting in New York, calls for repurchase of up to 20 pct of the common stock by the end of 1990. The GM board also authorized repurchase of up to five mln class E GME> and class H GMH> shares. GM shares closed at 75-5/8, up 7/8, in composite trading prior to the company's announcement. However subsequently Jefferies and Co, which trades NYSE-listed issues outside regular hours, said it was making a market in the shares at 77-1/2 to 78.

""I don't know where the money (for the buyback) is coming from unless they borrow,"" Glantz said. ""Their credit rating is going to fall."" GM said it anticipates a decrease in automotive capital spending. Glantz believes GM could be inviting a strike this fall by going ahead with the buyback program at a time when it has 37,000 employees on indefinite layoff and 11 plants marked for closing. After deciding against a profit sharing bonus for workers and buying out Perot for 743 mln dlrs ""this will be seen as rubbing salt into the wound,"" Glantz said. ""GM must be challenging the union to make it the strike target."" Glantz said he is not changing his buy recommendation on GM and expects the shares to rise. But he said he did not think the overall plan was ""prudent."" ""Obviously we're going to get at least an opening gap in the stock tomorrow,"" Hutton's Phillippi said. He says GM apparently believes as a result of a cost reduction program plus the falloff in capital spending levels ""they can handle a stock buyback of this magnitude within the confines of their cash flow.""

The International Swap Dealers Association has developed the first standard form contract for use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap transactions, said Thomas Jasper, the Association's co-chairman. The contract, unveiled at a press conference , is expected to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient, he said. ""The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce the expense of swap documentation,"" Japsper said. Privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all new issues eventually become part of either an interest rate or currency swap. An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usually acting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other's interest payments on debt securities. Usually, the issuer of a floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice versa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains with the original borrower. Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of swaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient capital to cushion it. Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and president of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital standards for counterparties in swaps. The standards are part of the recently announced convergence agreement between the two countries in which regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements for institutions. McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a ""level playing field"" be maintained in the swaps market. He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more primary capital against swap transactions than is the current practice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to issuers. The issuers might then choose to do business with lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking rules. He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort. That code should be completed within the next few weeks, he said. REUTER "

European Community Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen welcomed the agreement on details of dairy output cuts over two years and promised new measures to help farmers hurt by the drive to reduce EC surpluses. ""We are now in a favourable position to improve the situation in the dairy sector,"" he told a news conference. The Commission will be able to proceed with a 3.2 billion European Currency Unit plan to dispose of over a mln tonnes of butter in EC stores, as the deal should prevent major new stocks from accruing. A preliminary accord on the dairy package was reached in December, but approval was held up by a row over Commission proposals that it be given power to suspend sales of surplus stocks into store. After 36 hours of negotiations, ministers agreed detailed rules for such a suspension, allowing it only when new public stocks of butter exceed 180,000 tonnes and when market prices were sharply below those paid for sales into EC stores. Andriessen said the accord improves the atmosphere for what he said are bound to be tough discussions on his proposals for cuts in EC farm price cuts, notably in cereals, in the coming season. The ministers also approved a three-year 350 mln Ecu package of measures to help farmers in difficulty and pay compensation to those who opt for less intensive production methods. Andriessen said he regretted ministerial objections had forced him to withdraw sections of this package, for which he had originally earmarked 1.3 billion Ecus over five years. He said he would revise and resubmit plans to allow older farmers to take early retirement, either taking their land out of agricultural production or passing it to successors. The Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports to hard-pressed small farmers. Andriessen said he could not give full details, but member state aid would be subject to ""strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition."" Reuter "

Greece aims to reduce foreign borrowing to 1.6 or 1.7 billion dlrs this year from 2.6 billion in 1986, and will use some of the funds to make early debt servicing payments, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, Dimitris Halikias, said. He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceeded immediate needs, but Greece wanted to take advantage of low international interest rates in order to make servicing payments at a lower cost. Greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs at end-1986, up from 15.2 billion at end-1985, Halikias said. He said the extra funds available to Greece this year will go towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. He did not give figures. He said Greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-year austerity program it adopted in October, 1985 cut its current account deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record 3.3 billion in 1985.

Venezuela plans to have a public sector foreign debt of 26.5 billion dlrs by early 1989 when the present government of President Jaime Lusinchi ends its term, public finances director Jorge Marcano said. He said the target, which compares with around 24.5 billion dlrs now and 29 billion at end 1983, is considered a manageable amount which will assist in development plans. The government last week reached agreement with its 13-bank advisory committee to reprogramme its 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord over 14 years with the interest margin lowered to 7/8 pct over London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) from 1-1/8 pct. In an interview with El Universal newspaper, Marcano said he thought U.S. Government pressure on banks had more to do with the unexpectedly speedy agreement than Brazil's decision to suspend interest payments. ""I think what speeded an agreement was the attitude of the U.S. Government, which urged several major banks to soften their position in various debt renegotiations. The Brazil announcement came later,"" he said. Bankers noted Citibank had held up an agreement with Chile, objecting to proposals for delayed interest payments. A pact with Chile, with a one pct spread, came a day before Venezuela's. Marcano said a telex sent to Venezuela's 450 creditors seeks support for the government's foreign borrowing plans, which are aimed at aluminium, steel and iron ore projects. ""We cannot rule out a trip to financial centres to explain the new agreement and present the financing programmes we have,"" he said, adding he hoped to restore credit ratings of the 1970s. Lusinchi said on Monday the government will limit foreign borrowing, which would come from banks and multilateral agencies, to 50 pct of interest and principal paid in the next two years.

Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European Community levels, director-general of the INFE export institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said. ""The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now,"" he said. ""This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy, which have a similar productive structure,"" he said. The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in international trade fairs. Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted. Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20 billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant. The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year. Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand, which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985. He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S. ""The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of EC competition,"" he said. He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while turning their backs on foreign markets. ""They have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation,"" he said.

Public Service Co of New Mexico said it is evaluating placing its electric distribution system in a limited partnership with assets of about 400 mln dlrs. The utility said it advised a customer task force this is one restructuring alternative being considered for the company's electric business. The structure is being evaluated as part of the company's overall initiative in response to several goals announced by New Mexico Governor Garrey Carruthers, it explained. Public Service New Mexico said a central feature of its reorganization concept would be to separate the company's electric utility operation into independent generation and distribution entities, creating the opportunity for a targeted 35 mln dlr a year rate decrease. Noting the use of the limited partnership structure by a variety of businesses recently, the company said it believes ""the concept may well have an application in the utility business and intend to investigate it fully."" The generation company would provide projected power needs of the distribution entity under a 30-year ""power security agreement"" which would have a federally regulated rate structure, the company said. Public Service New Mexico said the restructuring could provide for its gas and water utilities and its non-utility companies becoming subsidaries of the proposed holding company approved by the company's shareholders in May 1986. This holding company would be the general partner of the limited partnership, the company said. The company said its limited partnership concept was presented to an ad hoc customer task force convened by Gov. Carruthers to review the company's reorganization proposals. It said the reorganization and limited partnership are an alternative structure that would help reduce rates through a lower overall cost of capital. Last month the governor said ""I have outlined to PNM critical goals which I have asked them to cooperate with may administration in achieving"" adding the goals include immediate rate reduction, stabilization of future rates and stimulation of business expansion. The company told the task force the new distribution company, under the limited partnership alternative or otherwise, would continue to be fully regulated by state regulators. PNM's proposed generation company would continue to be owned by common shareholders through the holding company. Its rates would be set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which regulates for wholesale electric power sales and transmission services. The generation company would have no retail customers.

The stock had been regarded as slightly expensive when it was announced and dealers said that even first thing this morning it had seemed slightly dear in relation to comparable existing stocks.

A leaf disease affecting seven pct of Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and researchers told Reuters. About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus ""corenes pora"" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago. Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes. Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken. ""The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease,"" an Institute spokesman said. Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares. The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones. Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken. Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December. ""If there is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise,"" a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said. Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period. Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas. Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with the supply position showing improvements. Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions. ""Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks, meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had,"" one buyer said. Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem. European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further. They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas. ""If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further shortages,"" one official said. ""But this again could benefit prices,"" a buyer said. Reuter "

Ford Motor Co F> and General Motors Corp GM> sell cars in Europe, where about 10.5 mln new cars a year are bought. GM also makes a few thousand in North American plants for European export. Now Chrysler Corp C> is saying it will begin exporting American-made vehicles before the end of this year to Europe, a market it left in 1978 when it was near bankruptcy. Ford's European operations in Britain and West Germany manufactured and sold about 1.5 million cars in Europe last year -- the largest U.S. Manufacturer's share of the European market. Opel/Vauxhall, with factories in West Germany, Spain and Britain, accounted for most of GM's sales in Europe with about 1.3 million vehicles in 1986, officials said. James Fry of GM overseas distribution system said GM hoped for a five-fold rise this year in sales of North American-made vehicles in Europe, selling between 7,000 and 8,000 (North American-made) units in Europe for the year to August 1987. ""A low dollar makes our prices very attractive,"" he told Reuters. Using an average price of 13,000 dlrs per car, his projected sales figure would translate into between 91 million and 104 mln dlrs in turnover, Fry added. That would be a jump from 1986 when GM sold 1,500 North-American made cars for revenue of 19 mln dlrs. Ford has 41 factories in West Europe, which manufacture all of its cars sold on the continent. But Walter Hayes, vice president of Ford Europe, told Reuters he did not expect a large rise in sales this year as a result of the weak dollar. ""We have concluded that despite the dollar difference.... Europe is inevitably a small volume market."" Hayes said the cost of changing American cars to conform to European environmental specifications cut into profit margins. But Robert Lutz, Chrysler executive vice-president, said the weak dollar would now help Chrysler compete in Europe. ""After a lapse of almost nine years, Chrysler is about to re-enter the European market,"" he said.

[u'west-germany']|"BUNDESBANK CHANGES REPURCHASE PACT SYSTEM

The Bundesbank is planning changes in the system by which banks bid for funds in securities repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open market instrument, central bank officials said. Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender process to two days from three currently, enabling the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it chooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly. The changes will probably come into force in April. Under the current system, banks must themselves specify at the tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank for subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business. Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody accounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks, which are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level. Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such accounts at the Hesse LZB, which covers the Frankfurt area. The change to come into force next month will allow the Bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself, in a process legally comparable to direct debiting. At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on Monday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces the result early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday. The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28 days. But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or longer tender periods being necessary. For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Friday to be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow (Thursday). The advance announcement took into account the carnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurt yesterday (Tuesday). Central bank officials and money market dealers said the shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely technical, with no direct implications for interest rates. ""It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter,"" said an official at the Hesse LZB. Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last December that security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater success since their introduction in their present form two years ago, and praised their flexibility. The tender process changes will make the repurchase pact instrument even more flexible, banking economists said. By speeding up the tender process, they will make it possible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for periods of less than a month, something long sought by banks, to respond to changing money market conditions. ""With the help of this instrument liquidity steering will be refined, but there won't be any effect on interest rates,"" said Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist Hermann Remsperger. The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to money market developments, but by steering liquidity, not interest rates, he said. REUTER "

The cost of living in West Germany will likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986, when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in the first recurrence of ""negative inflation"" since the 1950s, the HWWA economic research institute said. The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986 cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the value of the dollar, the institute said in a report. The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the first part of 1987. Provisional inflation figures for February released last week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct against the same month a year earlier.

The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other assets. Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England. The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan. The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments. Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain. Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank's minimum capital needs. The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank's current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure. The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the replacement cost. Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset. The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity. They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts. Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks, which are the principal participants in these types of activities. They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to compete in world financial markets. However, the staff concluded, ""The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations."" The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs. Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges. Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules. Reuter "

The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of social and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission sources said. The ministers agreed that under this ""extensification"" scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct. The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and wine, they added. Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case, farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC. The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego. The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment. It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such allowances are available only for livestock. The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques, the sources added. At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers. Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state aid would be subject to ""strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition."" EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production. The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay ""early retirement"" pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production. Those who took their land completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to their heirs, would have received more generous payments. Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed. Reuter "

The plan calls for Seneca to made an additional 500,000 dlr advance to Argo, National Fuel Gas said. National Fuel Gas said it reorganzation was proposed in a term sheet signed by Seneca, Argo and representatives of Argo's unsecured creditors committee.

The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said. The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals agreed in January between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said. It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals. The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma. ""On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively."" At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures. In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the plans showed. The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts. They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S. And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national government agencies, the proposals showed. The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges. It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to ""net"" contracts -- consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream. It recognised that ""such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation,"" and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account.

Failure of talks on re-establishing International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States, particularly the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by ""objective criteria"", U.S. officials said. Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head of Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary. Rosenbaum said the United States will be ""flexible"" in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas. At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S., proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks, while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer. Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S. customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas. He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks, but ""nobody is proposing we change our position."" However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia, to soften the consumer position. ""Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers,"" said one U.S. official. The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London. This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S. officials said. The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S. officials said. El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to objective criteria. There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question, U.S. officials said. Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions. In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said. This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals. However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks. A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult, although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans. While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position. U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement. Reuter "

International Business Machines Corp said it demonstrated an experimental computer chip called an opto-electronic receiver that transforms light into electrical signals that translate into computer language. IBM said the chip is two times faster than any similar chip reported and can read 40 encyclopedia volumes a second. The chip is made of gallium arsenide which moves electrical signals faster than the silicon used in most computer circuits. IBM also said that since gallium arsenide is more efficient in turning light signals into electrical signals, it seems to be an ideal material for the light-based computer communications expected to be widely used in the future. The chip's speed is also enhanced through the elimination of wiring by placing the functionally dissimilar photodetector and transistor circuitry close together. Bringing these elements closer together also isolates the receiver from other electronic circuits and reduces noise and distortion, it said. Reuter "

Torrential rains throughout Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May. The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year's harvest. Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires, with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors, between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40 mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis. No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa. Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates. Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week. Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates, or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to official figures. The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area. Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure of 3.14 mln hectares. Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985/86 harvest. Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985/86. Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes. Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures. Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares. Reuter "

[u'bop', u'trade', u'gnp', u'turkey', u'oecd']|"TURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986

Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said. He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985, which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand. Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year. This year's target of 20 pct ""might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful,"" he said. Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government's economic planning, said Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs. ""We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years,"" he added. His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus. ""In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit,"" he said. Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits. Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained. ""We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,"" he said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986. More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage exports, and production incentives were being considered. ""We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned,"" Tigrel said. He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible.

[u'crude', u'usa', u'opec']|"ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION

Drilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts said. Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said. ""Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,"" said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services, which tracks California drilling activity. ""It's in the dregs right now,"" said Bolster of the state's drilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell. Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs. More than half of California's oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, Malmgreen said. ""It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,"" Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission. So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled. ""I don't think they'll even get to what they did last year,"" Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission. In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of Conservation. ""Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,"" Guerard said. Reuter "

The Canadian Wheat Board has advised the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year beginning August 1, a board spokesman said. The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers. ""They're all lower,"" he said. ""This is really getting pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."" Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices. Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board. If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain, obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference. The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet. Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.

[u'earn', u'usa']|"TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS GM>

General Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share. GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects. ""I'm very positive on GM,"" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co. ""They're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value."" However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share. After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares, with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models. But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive. ""The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet,"" he said, since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock should settle back down to around 76, he added. Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs. Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates, which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987. ""On balance, GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors,"" he said. In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co F> and Chrysler Corp C> both posted increases. But GM said February sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects improvement in coming months. Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986, analysts said. The numbers include imports. Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback. ""GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major earnings surprise in the winds,"" he said. Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. ""The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler,"" he said. Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted. But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share. ""I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will only curtail losses in market share,"" which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990, Lucky said. Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he said results will not improve until 1988. ""I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a transition year for GM,"" he said. Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results. ""But the key thing isn't so much what they earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's important."" Reuter "

[u'japan']|"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN LOW GROWTH MODEL

Healthy growth in corporate profits and in consumer spending, the two pillars on which Japan rests its hopes of sustained economic growth, both look rotten at the core, economists polled by Reuters said. Profits and domestic consumption are meant to replace exports as the engine of growth. But close ties between corporate performance and wages mean that the alternative economic model promises little but slower growth, they said. Falling profits may lead to falling incomes, which in turn will cut sales and further reduce profits. The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improved terms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic demand grow steadily. However, this would happen only if household spending increased in line with the value of real financial assets due to stable prices, and/or if corporate investment recovered as profits from domestic sales improved compared with those from exports. ""No clear sign of such developments has so far been evidenced,"" the central bank said. Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth will be slow, even though Japan's terms of trade have improved sharply due to the strong yen. Economist David Pike of Phillips and Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct while output prices fell only eight pct, giving a large price margin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companies did not pass that advantage on to the consumer. Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between the fall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in consumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of trade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors. The economists, however, believe this layer of fat will protect companies for only a short while. As more firms seek more profits at home instead of abroad, already fierce domestic competition will increase, fueled by lower-priced imports. Retail prices will fall. Profit margins will suffer. A December survey by top business organisation Keidanren confirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves. Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector, almost 80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production volume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance, said Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara. Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cutting unprofitable operations, reducing work to sub-contractors (which employ significant numbers of workers), holding down wages, and reducing bonuses. The government has said it fears unemployment could soon double from three pct now. Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt sales. But reduced bonuses, and worries about individual financial security could be even more damaging. Twice a year, bonuses provide wage earners with what amounts to an enforced lump sum in savings, encouraging them to buy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza. To save funds, some big firms have begun a form of tied bonus, forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods. Economists also predict Japanese will not save less than the average 16 pct of salary they do now. On the contrary, a poor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the resolve to put money aside for old age and illness, education, and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary. The last government survey of public opinion said over 80 pct of citizens will continue to economise. Japan has a rapidly ageing population and minimal social security and its workers fear poverty in their old age. Faced with such a vicious circle, the government's reflationary strategies are severely limited. The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Finance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in small supplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentive without reducing revenue. Independent economists have been less than excited at the results. Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited. The 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politically impossible to cut it further, with the basic bank savings rate at only 0.25 pct, Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said. Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in some kind of deposit, official figures show. Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive while firms are planning cuts in capital investment. The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and land prices are the only current results of high liquidity. Fear of inflation also limits policy options.

Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells. Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers. His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production. Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves. Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel. ""We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,"" Nugent said. ""In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way.""

Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export quotas. ""We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions,"" Gaviria told Reuters in an interview. The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London. Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it impossible. In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences, not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries. He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less. According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export revenue. That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400 mln dlrs from 1986.

Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8 billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial spending will be internally financed. Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific Bell operating company. In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility Commission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the commission, he said the figure might even be greater. The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found 180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded modernization costs. Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether to join an international consortium that plans to lay a transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan.

""(Long distance services) is a very competitive business. It's a commodity business and becoming more so,"" he said. ""I'm not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that business."" However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S. recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic alliances with other companies. He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition talks. ""We do not have anything actively under consideration,"" he said.

[u'interest', u'money-fx', u'uk', u'usa']|"NEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED, DEALERS SAY

U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said. After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk. Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals. Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals. ""What they are proposing is really double counting,"" Patrick de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default. ""The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected,"" said a director at one U.K. merchant bank. ""What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now -- to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now,"" he added.(Adds title first paragraph). Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers. Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules. Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is, offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other. The paper said that regulatory authorities ""recognize that such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk."" Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly. But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design. ""One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court,"" said one bank official. Reuter "

[u'canada']|"BANK OF CANADA MADE AGGRESSIVE USE OF T-BILLS

The Canadian government's reduced borrowing needs enabled the Bank of Canada to make ""aggressive use"" of short term debt instruments and pare the cost of financing in 1986, the central bank said in its annual report. The report, authored by retired governor Gerald Bouey, also noted advances to Canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrs at the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in January, 1986, and that the country's economy performed unevenly while inflation remained a major concern. Bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new bond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen the reliance on Canada Savings Bonds while raising substantailly more through short term treasury bill financings. ""The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances and lower financing costs,"" said Bouey who was replaced by deputy governor John Crow last month. The amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was 69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984. The reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an eight billion dlr decline in the government's financing requirements, a run down in Ottawa's cash balances, and generation of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange transactions. Also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank made greater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to five year maturities, Bouey said. Bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made to banks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an average of 832.3 mln dlrs at end of December from a peak of 5.2 billion dlrs in March, 1986. The advances were made largely to four banks, Canadian Commercial Bank, Northland Bank, Continental Bank of Canada and the Bank of British Columbia. The first two banks have been liquidated, which enabled partial repayment of advances, and the remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid the advances. Reuter "

[u'cme']|"CME POSTPONES RULING ON DUAL TRADING PETITION

Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, directors have postponed action on a membership petition calling for a ban on dual trading, CME Chairman Jack Sandner told Reuters. Consideration of the petition was scheduled for a regular board meeting today, but directors first wanted the opinions of a special committee that has been studying trading conditions in the Standard and Poor's 500 futures pit for the last six months. ""We didn't want to preempt the committee,"" Sandner said. Instead, Sandner said the board will wait for the findings of the special S and P committee, which is considering some type of restriction on dual trading in S and P 500 futures. Dual trading is the legal practice in which an exchange member can execute customer orders as well as trade for his own account. Critics maintain the practice provides an opportunity for traders to ""front-run"" or trade their own accounts at more favorable prices before customer orders are executed. Sandner said he expects the special committee to report its findings late next week and the board to act when those findings are presented. In response to reports that the CME board is opposed to a ban on dual trading, Sandner pointed out that the board already unanimously approved a partial ban on dual trading in S and P 500 futures at a prior meeting. The change was withheld, however, at the request of the special committee after a study was released and the committee felt the issue should be addressed more comprehensively, Sandner said. Sandner said that he personally had no aversion to a ban on dual trading and ""the leadership (of the CME) is not opposed to a ban on dual trading."" Last week, CME special counsel Leo Melamed said the special study committee is considering changes only for S and P 500 futures and options on futures. In addition to the dual trading issue, the committee is also expected to make recommendations on the possibility for electronic order entry and execution for S and P 500 futures and rule changes to alleviate crowded conditions in the S and P trading pit, Melamed said. Melamed said at the time that in matters where a special committee is appointed, recommendations from the committee are usually approved by the exchange board of directors. Reuter "

Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official told Reuters. ""How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement if the United States does not want to offer us grain at competitive prices?"" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States. ""We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive prices,"" he said in an interview.

""We are being accused of not implementing this agreement. We do not consider we are at fault,"" Melnikov said. Article I in the agreement states that ""purchases/sales of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms.""

[u'usa']|"LEGISLATORS COOL TO NEW STOCK TAX IDEA

Key tax and budget lawmakers Wednesday expressed reservations about the suggested new securities tax, which has has aroused concern on Wall Street and put pressure on brokerage stocks. Grappling with the need to either raise taxes or cut federal spending to meet the fiscal 1988 budget deficit target of 108 billion dlrs, House Speaker Jim Wright suggested the tax be studied as one way to raise more federal revenues. The Texas Democrat's idea as first presented to House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski this week would tax sales and purchases of securities. A tax of 0.25 to 0.5 percent would raise from 8.5 to 17 billion dlrs a year. Rostenkowski, the chief taxwriter, considers it too early to back any tax increase idea but agreed to add the securities transfer tax to a long list of tax alternatives under review by congressional tax analysts, a spokesman said. The Illinois Democrat has repeatedly stressed this year he is reluctant to back a tax increase so long as President Reagan maintains his staunch opposition. ""First we've got to decide whether to raise additional revenues. Only then can we consider the specific options. At this point nothing is on or off the table. It's just too early,"" Rostenkowski said in a statement. He made no commitment to Wright in a private meeting Tuesday, and in fact was not asked for one, a House source said. The idea was presented only as something that might or might not be valuable, he said. House Budget Committee chairman William Gray agreed it was another option to be looked at, if Congress decided it needed to raise revenues to reduce the deficit, an aide said. The Pennsylvania Democrat does not intend to recommend specific tax proposals, the aide said. The Budget Committee will recommend a certain amount of revenue to be raised in 1988, but will leave to the taxwriting committee the decision on how the taxes will be raised. The securities transfer tax would raise a hefty amount of revenue to ease Congress's difficult task of trimming the deficit by 61 billion dlrs this year to meet the target. But some in Congress feared that such a tax could drive securities business offshore and hurt U.S. investment, and there were uncertainties about the details of the tax. Democrats have not united behind any budget alternatives so far this year. This week they are scheduled to discuss the budget and possible spending cuts or tax increases but no decisions are anticipated, congressional sources said. At the same time, without President Reagan's assent to a general tax increase, they are left with piecemeal taxes that are guaranteed to anger those who must pay. ""We could just do all of them,"" one congressional source said of the various tax ideas -- excise taxes, securities taxes, oil import fee and others. Reuter "

A senior British official said that protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the global trading system. Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers, ""the community would have to retaliate."" His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports. Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress. De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks. Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs. Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods. Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs. ""The more united pressure there could be, the better,"" he said. Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes. He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards. ""But if both sides drew back from the brink that time,"" he said, """"it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion.""

Dome Petroleum Ltd's plan to reschedule debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs will likely be detailed to a group of 56 major creditors on Monday or Tuesday next week, a company spokesman said. Circulation of the complex plan to reschedule the company's debt was delayed to incorporate late changes resulting from discussions with Dome's lenders, spokesman David Annesley told Reuters in response to an inquiry. Annesley said Dome expects its debt will total between 6.3 billion and 6.5 billion dlrs by June 30, 1987, when it hopes to implement the debt plan now under negotiation. Annesley said Dome Petroleum would issue a statement outlining the company's debt rescheduling proposal following release of the plan to lenders. Dome Petroleum previously said it hoped to submit the debt plan by mid-February in order to win agreement in principle from creditors prior to June 30. The group of major lenders have agreed to defer a substantial amount of debt payments until June 30 under an interim agreement that links payments to secured lenders with cash flow generated by assets backing the loans. Annesley also said there was no change in the status of legal actions initiated by six Swiss noteholders who are seeking interest and principal payment on their unsecured debt. Together, the noteholders are owed about 520,000 Swiss francs, and their legal action places a total of 300 mln Swiss franc denominated debt in default.

Trans World Airlines Inc complicated the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with Piedmont and USAir. Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin. TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price. TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the airlines. Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena. ""We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else,"" said one arbitrager. ""We think TWA might just be putting up a trial balloon."" Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir, but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals. They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements. ""They need to show their commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a credible offer,"" said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst. ""I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals,"" said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers. USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock. USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln shares. Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp. Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of Piedmont. Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target. ""Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines,"" said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming. ""I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package,"" said Kim. But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load. Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do the offer. The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements. Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp X> and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock. Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal. Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA offer on price and financing concerns. ""It's littered with contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing arrangement,"" said one executive at another major airline. But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast, to the mix would develop an even stronger force. The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation system. Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share. Reuter "

The failure of talks to introduce new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee Agreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil having a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon said. He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25 pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected. ""Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,"" Calmon added. Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota, Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln bags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln, leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export. ""It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was better than such a quota reduction,"" he added. In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green coffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under 10 mln bags. Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, of which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest this year should be around 30 mln bags, he added.

The figures represented a slight recovery for the industry from weak mid-February sales, but the eight domestic-based car manufacturers still saw sales fall 9.1 pct for the full month from last year.

Last year, the industry sold a record 11.44 mln new cars, including 8.2 mln domestic makes.

The company said it would sell all of its businesses other than the American Air Filter business, make a public financing of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently outstanding debt with the proceeds. Under the plan, which was presented to institutional lenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, ""substantial amounts"" of institutional debt would be converted to common stock of the restructured company. Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred stock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and preferred stock for common equity will cause a ""resulting dilution of the existing common stock,"" Allis-Chalmers said in a statement. Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about 15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common. Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is bankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors, common and preferred holders,and present and former employees. Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing ""appears to represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the terms of the plan cannot be reached."" The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that would result from the restructuring. ""It is too early to talk about a charge"" because the plan must still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said. Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' private lenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met. Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees would be made ""at substantially reduced levels."" Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment companies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with businesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling and solid materials processing. Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to AC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio. Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell its solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses. Solid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush stones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of Allis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs. The company will also sell its fluids handling operations, which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196 mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues. Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs, or 12.27 dlrs a share. The company's last profit was in 1980, when it earned 52.4 mln dlrs on sales of 2.1 billion dlrs. Reuter "

A former TRW Inc controller told a Congressional hearing that the company had acted unethically in its defense contracts with the government. ""It is my contention that the company called TRW is not ever vigilant and highly ethical as a defense contractor. TRW only pretends to be an honest citizen when that scheme best fits their financial interests,"" Larry Eagleye said in testimony at a House Oversight subcommittee hearing. Eagleye was a controller at TRW's compressor components division in Cleveland. Subcommittee chairman John Dingell, D-Mich, said he did not understand why the Defense Department had taken no action against TRW even though it admitted in the 1984 report that it had substantially overcharged the government for military aircraft parts. ""In 1984, TRW officials admitted to the Defense Department Inspector General that they had evidence of two sets of books and other problems in one of the company's divisions in Cleveland and that there had been substantial overcharging of the federal government on various military aircraft parts,"" Dingell said.

The U.S. Army has delayed plans to buy a European anti-aircraft missile to help protect U.S. ground forces from Soviet attack helicopters, Defense Department officials said. The Army has been considering buying some British Rapier missiles or French and German Roland missiles as a stop-gap partial replacement this year for the flawed U.S. Sgt. York Division Air Defense (DIVAD) gun which was canceled in 1985. Despite recent indications by the service that it intended to buy the missiles soon, defense officials told Reuters a final decision had been suspended because some Army officials favored a more versatile gun-missile combination. The gun-missile combination would open the competition wide to U.S. firms. ""The missile option is on hold now and no decision has been made,"" said one of the Pentagon official, who asked not to be identified. ""There is some sentiment to take things more slowly and see if we can avoid a stop-gap system until we can come up with an integrated system of our own,"" said another official. Army Lt. Col.

[u'france', u'oecd']|"INTERNATIONAL BORROWING REACHES RECORD IN 1986

Record high borrowing of 376 billion dlrs in 1986 on international capital markets was supported by a large volume of debt refinancing and growing integration between national and international markets, the OECD said. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its latest Financial Market Trends report the 34 pct rise over 1985 volume was accompanied by major changes in the relative importance of the instruments used in international financing. Straight bond offerings, equity related securities and euro-commercial paper programmes as a share in total financing rose to their highest level this decade. The markets for floating-rate notes and for note issuance facilities declined. The OECD said another striking feature of international capital markets in 1986 was the unprecedented concentration of lending to the OECD group of western industrialised countries, which accounted for 90 pct of total borrowing. Factors behind the heightened pace of activity included a notable decline in interest rates which boosted borrowing through the flotation of fixed-interest securities. This in turn was stimulated by growing familiarity with new techniques such as interest rate and currency swaps. Stockmarket buoyancy supported the expansion of equity-related bond issues and favoured the expansion of a rapidly expanding market for euro-equities. A slowdown in net demand for funds by sovereign borrowers was more than offset by a large volume of refinancing operations induced by improved market conditions and stronger debt management policies. Growing integration with national markets meant the arrival of a large number of new players on international markets. It added the development of a smoothly-functioning market for short-term euro-notes made committee and non-underwritten issuance facilities an increasingly popular alternative to traditional forms of bank lending. Turning to 1987, the OECD pointed to indications of a possible slowdown of international markets' expansion and possibly less easy borrowing terms in a number of market areas. It said many market participants saw little scope for a further decline in long-term rates and anticipate a slowdown in the pace of fixed-rate activity in the months ahead. It saw little reason for a turnaround in the decline in demand of recent years, although it was likely more borrowers would try to make use of cost-reducing opportunities provided by the market for euro-commercial paper. ""It remains to be seen however to what extent the ECP market will be ready to absorb a significant volume of paper from lower-rated borrowers,"" the report said, adding that any major advance in the euro-note market's absorptive capacity would require a significantly broader investor base.

[u'usa', u'nymex']|"NYMEX OUTGOING CHAIRMAN SEES MAJOR CHANGES

Trading in energy futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange will change dramatically over the next five to 10 years as the market matures, according to outgoing chairman Michel Marks. ""Energy futures trading is going through a tremendous period of transition that will last five to 10 years,"" Marks said, adding that volume will soar, international participation will increase, and activity of producing countries, major oil companies, and speculators will grow. Marks steps down as chairman after an nine-year tenure when board elections are held March 17. He will continue as chairman of a long-range planning committee at NYMEX. ""The priority of the next 10 years is operational efficiency versus the last 10 years when it was new product development,"" said Marks. Marks said it is imperative for NYMEX, which is running out of trading space, to process greater volumes expeditiously in order to handle the growth in volumes and new contracts that are already planned. Marks said crude futures volume could more than double by the end of the decade to 250,000 contracts daily and combined products volume could soar to 100,000 contracts a day. Much of the increased activity will come from the international sector, according to Marks. ""That's a huge growth area,"" he said, adding that it will run the gamut from foreign producer countries to foreign independent operators. He said it would be difficult to develop a futures contract based on an internationally traded crude although he previously said the exchange is exploring that possibility. ""Trying to develop a futures contract in any other crude besides West Texas Intermediate will be a tough task"" he said. Marks said it is more likely a futures contract based on an international product rather than an international crude will be developed since the products market is more diverse. He said previously the exchange is studying the possibility of developing a non-U.S. deliverable products contract. Other sources of growth for U.S. energy futures are the major oil companies, which already trade on the NYMEX, and institutional funds such as investment houses, pension funds, and insurance companies, Marks said. ""The commodities markets have become financial markets and should pursue a partnership with financial intermediaries,"" Marks said. He said speculators will increase their share of the energy futures markets in the coming years from the current share of about 30 pct. Hedgers, as a result, will lose some of their 70 pct share.

The legislation before the committee would recapitalize a federal desposit insurance fund for savings and loan associations and prohibit new nonbank banks.

Ivory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in London would not last long. Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions. ""I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April,"" he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks. Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the lowest since 1982. Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues. He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month. Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks. ""An initiative from IACO is likely very soon,"" he said without elaborating. ""Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market,"" he said. Questioned by journalists, the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season. Last year, the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents) per kilo. Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation. A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed ""his faith in Ivory Coast's bright (economic) future"" despite the commodities price slide. The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country's small farmers. Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee.

[u'usa']|"CHARTS SIGNAL BULLISH BREAKOUT IN DEBT FUTURES

The rally Wednesday in U.S. interest rate futures left the Treasury bond contract above the top of a three month trading range which signals a bullish chart breakout, financial analysts said. In addition, sluggish U.S. economic data and little sign that the economy will pick up its pace in the near future may be enough to send bond futures to all-time highs, the analysts said. ""The market is paying more attention to the weakened state of the economy right now,"" said Refco analyst Mike Connery. Connery said the four pct drop in January U.S. factory orders reinforced sentiment that first quarter economic growth will be slow. Connery and other analysts noted that talk of a cut in the Lombard rate after sluggish West German industrial production figures also provided some support. ""The domestic economies of the major trading partners of the U.S. may deteriorate to such an extent that they will be forced to ease,"" thus paving the way for a more accomodative U.S. credit policy, added John Michael, analyst at First Options of Chicago. Michael pointed out, however, that trimming the U.S. trade deficit -- the ultimate aim of the recent meeting of major industrial countries -- may not necessarily aid bond prices. ""The surplus (for exporters to the U.S.) is bullish for bonds because they (exporters) have a lot of dollars. Rather than translate those into their own currencies and suffer exchange rate risk, they buy dollar-denominated instruments,"" Michael said. Indeed, futures traders with cash bond connections said some of the late strength in the bond market resulted from buying by Japanese interests. But the analysts said the heavy buying in futures occurred after the June bond broke above stiff resistance at 101-2/32. ""The breakout is pretty important,"" said chartist Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston. ""Not only did bonds close above recent highs but they were also above the sideways pattern we've been in for the last three months."" Also positive on a technical basis was the fact that the June bond contract held chart support early near 100-4/32, and that the rally occurred on heavy volume, Keefe said. Keefe said the next level of significant chart resistance will be at 101-24/32 to 101-28/32. Furthermore, ""we still have the April (1986) highs to contend with,"" which in the nearby contract is 105-15/32. Michael said the breakout projects gains to 103 in June T-bonds and ""there is an outside chance to reach 106."" Keefe warned, however, that confirmation also is needed from other technical indicators such as relative strength indexes and short-term momentum indicators. ""Without them, sustained strength is in question,"" Keefe said. Reuter "

President Reagan, fighting to regain public confidence in the wake of the Iran arms scandal, admitted tonight that the clandestine operation wound up as an arms-for-hostages deal and, ""It was a mistake."" ""When it came to managing the NSC (National Security Council) staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its previous track record,"" Reagan said in a television address to the American people. ""I have already begun correcting this,"" he added in his prepared remarks. Reagan's speech, widely regarded as critical to his hopes of repairing his presidency, was his first detailed response to last week's scorching Tower commission report on the secret sale of arms to Iran and diversion of profits to U.S.-backed contra rebels in Nicaragua. Reagan said he had been silent on the scandal while he waited for the truth to come out and admitted, ""I've paid a price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence."" He said that a few months ago, he told the American people he did not trade arms for hostages in the 18-month covert operation. ""My heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not,"" Reagan said. ""There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses. It was a mistake,"" he said. Reagan again said that the original Iran initiative was to develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a post-Khomeini government. ""It's clear from the Board's report however that I let my personal concern for the hostages spill over into the geo-political strategy of reaching out to Iran. ""I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that I didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan,"" he said. The commission, headed by former Republican Sen. John Tower, said Reagan's ""intense compassion"" for Americans being held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon had resulted in an unprofessional and unsatisfactory policy. It portrayed 76-year old Reagan as a man who did not know or care much about the wide-ranging, probably illegal activities of his National Security Council (NSC) staff, which hatched the operation. Reagan said he endorsed all of the Tower commission's recommendations about the running of the NSC, adding, ""In fact, I'm going beyond its recommendations, so as to put the house in even better order."" He noted that he had appointed former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker as his new chief of staff and said he hoped Baker would help him forge a new partnership with Congress, ""especially on foreign and national security policies."" He said his new national security adviser, Frank Carlucci, was rebuilding the national security staff ""with proper management discipline."" Reagan said that almost half the NSC professional staff now consisted of new people. He said that FBI Director William Webster, his new nominee to head the CIA, ""understands the meaning of 'rule of law'"". Reagan also announced that Tower had agreed to serve as a member of his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which acts as a watchdog on the nation's covert activities. But he said that he had issued a directive barring the NSC staff itself from undertaking covert operations -- ""No ifs, ands, or buts."" Tonight's speech was a far cry from Reagan's initial strong defense of his Iran policy. In a televised speech last November 13, Reagan called charges that he ransomed hostages and undercut the U.S. war on terrorism ""utterly false."" As recently as two months ago in his State of the Union speech, Reagan said that ""serious mistakes were made"" but defended the basic policy as one that had worthy goals. By contrast, tonight's speech had an apologetic tone that was a marked departure from Reagan's usual upbeat, confident demeanor. He said he took full responsibility for his own actions ""and for those of my administration."" ""As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I am still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior,"" Reagan said. Reagan said the message that the nation should move on had come from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, from allies around the world -- ""and if we're reading the signals right, even from the Soviets."" His remark seemed to be a reference to a new Soviet willingness to reach an agreement on eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. Reuter "

In a televised address to the American people Reagan said he is still upset that no-one kept proper records -- a complaint made by the Tower commission. The arms shipment was made in August of 1985 by Israel. ""I did approve it; I just can't specifically say when,"" Reagan said. Reagan added: ""Rest assured, there's plenty of record-keeping now going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (the White House)."" The timing of Reagan's approval of the Israeli shipment is important because it could determine whether the sale violated various laws, including the Arms Export Control Act. Reuter "

He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea. Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975.

[u'indonesia', u'suharto']|"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - INDONESIA'S ECONOMY

Indonesia heads for general elections in six weeks' time with its economy in the worst shape in 20 years, economists and officials said. The government expects no spillover of ""people power"" from the neighbouring Philippines to unsettle the 20-year rule of President Suharto, victory for whose ruling Golkar party in the coming parliamentary elections is assured. However, Western diplomats said it is the country's deteriorating economic position that is the main threat to its stability. Last year's collapse in oil prices dealt a heavy blow to Indonesia, halving its revenue from oil and gas exports to 6.5 billion dlrs last year from 12.4 billion in 1985. Oil and gas account for 70 pct of export income. The result is that in the run-up to April 23 elections, Suharto, far from wooing his 168 mln countrymen with pay increases or tax cuts, is busy slashing budget spending. The government has also recently increased transport fares and frozen the pay of the civil service and the army for the second year running, despite inflation now estimated at 8.8 pct. The current account deficit rose to 4.09 billion dlrs in 1986 from 1.8 billion in 1985, while the debt service ratio widened to 33.2 pct for 1987 from 25 pct in 1986. Foreign debt repayments of 4.6 billion dlrs account for almost a third of the 1987/88 budget. A recent U.S. Embassy report on the economy said 1986 gross domestic product growth was the lowest since the mid-1960s when Suharto came to power. Western economists said GDP registered nil growth or contracted last year after 1.9 pct growth in 1985, and predicted only a one pct rise this year. In its efforts to return to growth seen in the oil-boom years of the 1970s when the economy grew an average seven pct, the government is now relying more on foreign borrowings. Indonesia has asked foreign governments to finance its share of new projects being built with overseas money, because it cannot afford even to meet local costs. In the last three months Indonesia has taken out new loans totalling 1.55 billion dlrs, on top of its external debt of 37 billion dlrs. Western bankers said more will be needed, and the country now ranks sixth among Third World debtors. A 350 mln dlr commercial loan signed in Tokyo in December was followed in the first week of February with a 300 mln dlr loan from the World Bank to support the balance of payments. Last month, Japan's Export-Import Bank agreed a 900 mln dlr loan to meet Indonesia's share of 21 World Bank projects which would otherwise have been scrapped or postponed. More loans are on the way, including two more from the World Bank worth a total 300 mln dlrs for roads and irrigation. U.S. Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz said in a recent speech that economic growth remains the key to preserving Indonesia's fundamental stability. The largest Moslem nation in the world, Indonesia has so far avoided some of the more extreme paths of other Moslem countries. But the World Bank has warned that mounting unemployment could start causing severe social strains unless it is tackled. It said in its annual report on Indonesia last June that unless economic growth is revived, unemployment could reach what it termed ""unacceptable levels."" Unemployment was officially put at 4.8 pct at the end of last year, but those considered underemployed number around 35 pct. What path to take appears to be a matter of some dispute within Suharto's government, with his Western-trained technocrats advocating more of the classic remedies supported by the international financial community. But another group supports a protected economy, with more import substitution, the U.S. Embassy report said. The government devalued the rupiah by 31 pct against the dollar last September to help exports and curb imports, and is currently working on a series of measures to further encourage foreign investment and boost exports outside the oil sector. The direction Suharto takes could affect Indonesia's ability to raise new loans in the future, Western bankers say. So far, despite three packages of economic measures over the past nine months, he has not touched key monopolies that are linked to businesses controlled either by his family or by business associates, diplomats and bankers say. Diplomats and investors are now looking for action on monopolies and the loss-making state sector as signs that Suharto is serious about tackling the country's problems. REUTER "

[u'japan', u'usa']|"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EUROYEN BOND ISSUES INCREASE

The easing of rules governing overseas use of the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity but has failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency, bond managers and traders said. Although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues in the Eurobond market, few foreigners are interested in keeping the yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but the Japanese, they said. This lack of real yen demand through the freer Euroyen market is undermining the 1984 U.S. And Japanese accord to internationalise the yen, they said. The borrowers want to take advantage of low Japanese interest rates but have no need for yen. They arrange primarily with Japanese banks to exchange yen funds into other currencies, mainly dollars, bond managers said. More than 85 pct of Euroyen bond issues are swap driven, they added. ""The borrowers don't care which currency they use. They are only after attractive money,"" one bond trader said. Issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previous year, boosting Euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of the total Eurobond market, Koichi Kimura, managing director of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, said recently. Traders said some of the activity stems from battles among Japanese and foreign securities companies and banks for the prestige of placing a larger share of issues. Many even resort to ""harakiri"" swaps, those with unprofitable pricing. But the fever continues and the number of offerings could double again in 1987, said Naoki Yokoyama, manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's international capital markets operation. The Euroyen bonds, once issued, are mostly picked up by Japanese trust banks, one trader said. After a 90 day waiting period the bonds flow back to Japan where investor appetite is strong, he added. Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when more attractive yields are offered on dollar and other currency investments, traders said. ""Even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing (in yen),"" said Masaki Shimazu, manager of Daiwa's bond department. While few foreigners are interested in the secondary market, Japanese commercial banks, regional banks, life insurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy the bonds and await their flow back to Japan since they offer little currency risk, traders said. The Finance Ministry last April shortened the waiting period before issues could flow back to Japan to 90 days from 180. A ministry official said it verified through sampling that reflow was fairly small. ""We believe the Euroyen bond should remain mainly in the Euroyen market,"" he said. One trader said that although demand from Japanese investors is heavy, it may prove to be only short-term. He said many investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or U.S. Interest rates decline further. To encourage further international use of the yen, the ministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyen commercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studying demand from potential borrowers. Securities company sources believe the ministry will permit non-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the next few months. But they expect it to continue to ban domestic participation in the market for some time to come. Japanese banks object to the short-term paper market which they see encroaching on their business territory. Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur more demand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift into shorter-term securities if need be. ""Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps,"" one bond manager said. If more financial instruments were available, there might be more trades in yen, he added. Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, though some recent issues which are callable in three years work as if they had shorter maturities, traders said. The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bond maturities within a few months. One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authorities are giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules governing international transactions of the yen. But freer use of the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the Japanese currency, he said. ""If exporters or importers can raise funds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using the Japanese yen as a settlement currency,"" he added. The Finance Ministry official said the government must constantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of borrowers and investors.

It said a joint field survey late last month by the association, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand indicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region is lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces. The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of 1986.

The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and 13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth, share analysts polled by Reuters said. Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion. They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue. Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year, probably one for three or one for five. The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd HSGH.HK> is to report its 1986 results on Friday. Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to 12 pct. They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985. Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise, Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct. ""They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand, as their loan portfolio is well balanced,"" an analyst at Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said. Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985. Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985. Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986, but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds. The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply. ""The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks,"" one analyst said. The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd WAIA.HK> and James Capel and Co>, analysts said. ""Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter,"" an analyst said. Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr flotation of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time. The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake in South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs. The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said. Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced need to write off bad debts. ""The need for provisions was much lower than the year before,"" said Tony Measor of Hong Leong Securities Co Ltd. ""Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to 2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions."" Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs. The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its 51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc MM>, appears to have improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986 fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145 mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985. REUTER "

[u'money-fx', u'dlr', u'yen', u'usa', u'japan', u'ec']|"NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN

The highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said. The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely. ""You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza,"" he said. On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms. ""The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg,"" said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems. ""This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge,"" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. ""If you want my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again,"" he said.

Japanese creditor banks are close to a decision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which they will transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverable debts owed by developing nations, international financial sources told Reuters. Details of the deal are likely be decided next week and the firm set up before the end of the month, they said. The scheme is intended to improve financial management at the banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts turning bad, the sources said. Last week's announcement by Brazil that it would indefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted Japanese creditors to finalise the project, the sources said. Major Japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid a debt crisis since the start of the year, they said. There are likely to be at least 10 participating banks, and perhaps as many as 28, they said. About 30 Japanese commercial banks have outstanding loans totalling over 10 billion dlrs to Brazil, accounting for about 15 pct of all commercial loans to that country. The most likely venue for the envisaged firm is the Caribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands, the sources said. The idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm with participating creditor banks holding the firm's stock. The firm will then use the funds to buy from its stock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreign loans which are potentially bad, the sources said. The stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans. Subject to the scheme would be loans extended to debt-ridden countries such as Mexico and Argentina, they said. The financial sources said interest payments to the firm would not be taxed because of its location. Japanese banks have asked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan loss reserves, but the ministry has not yet complied. A senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said it may encourage new lending to developing countries.

Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party started moves to push through the delayed draft budget for 1987/88 through Parliament, deepening a clash with the opposition which called the move rash and unforgivable. In the absence of the opposition, LDP members of parliament decided at a meeting of the Lower House Steering Committee to hold a public hearing on the draft budget on March 13 and 14, parliamentary officials said. The step came after Parliament resumed deliberations last Tuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over a controversial government-proposed sales tax plan. Four opposition parties led by the Socialists have been delaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales tax on which the budget plan is based. A Socialist spokesman said the opposition would again boycott parliament unless the LDP changed its mind.

The outlook for the West German economy is relatively bright, with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel University's Institute for World Economy said. The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct. In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's strength against the dollar and other major currencies. ""The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in all, limited,"" the report said. ""On the contrary, a slight rise in exports can be expected."" The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges. They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year. West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy, the institute said. However, it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours. The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation. It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession. It said central banks in industrialized countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal Reserve Board's expansionary course. The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S. Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world. Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home. The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct. REUTER "

Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago. Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. Some of them are ""too sophisticated to convert into financial terms,"" one banking source said. But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate. They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory. ""Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems,"" one said. The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission. According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders. But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as ""a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation."" A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed. Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show. Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons. ""Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons,"" said one expert. ""It's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy."" ""There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it,"" another said, adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality. Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as ""nebulous,"" one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges. Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry. ""MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now,"" said one Western envoy. He said Polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland's efforts to regain entry. Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently. Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, ""Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs."" While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a ""moral right"" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said ""The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity."" Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States. He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States, ""but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners."" He stressed that the U.S. ""had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt."" Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role. ""As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations,"" he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

The Bank of France is likely to cut its money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the start of next week. This follows a steady decline in the call money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said. The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks of turbulence. The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February 23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3, where it has now stabilised. Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct. While call money has dropped by well over a percentage point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide. The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at 8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5. The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while using the intervention rate to set the floor. Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday, although an earlier cut could not be excluded. A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early as tomorrow morning, banking sources said. They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving scope for a small fall in rates. M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished 1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target, rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985. REUTER "

The Hong Kong dollar fixed rate market was shut down this afternoon after a 200 mln H.K. Dlr certificate of deposit issue for the Chinese state-owned Bank of Communications Ltd Hong Kong branch suddenly surfaced, bankers said. Disgruntled dealers said the market was slowly on the road to recovery after a bout of sell-off that began in early February but it was still too fragile to absorb a new issue. Brokers said the new deal took them by surprise and all major players stopped making markets in existing issues. The fixed rate market, which consists mainly of CDs tied to swaps or asset repackaging, began to fall about a month ago due to indigestion after 18 CD issues totalling 2.3 billion dlrs flooded the market in January. Bankers said the shake-up was a result of participants pushing the market up too fast in January amid intense speculation that the Hong Kong dollar's 7.80 peg rate against the U.S. Dollar would soon be changed. The speculation depressed local interest rates and unleashed a flood of new issues. But the speculation faded in early February and interest rates climbed as the government remained adamant in maintaining the peg, thus triggering an adjustment on the fixed rate capital market. By late February the market had recovered considerably but Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York launched their issues and pushed the market down again. Since then there has been no new issues for nearly two weeks until China Development Finance Co (H.K.) Ltd (CDFC), a unit of the Bank of China, launched the five-year deal at 7.05 pct with quarterly interest payment in mid-afternoon today. Brokers said the market was steady early this morning but began to slip marginally by late morning as rumours of a new issue circulated. When the deal was launched the major players quickly suspended trading and refused to quote prices for their own issues, brokers said. ""We just don't know where the market is going,"" said a European banker. They said the Bank of Communications issue traded at a low of 99.70 but was later pushed up to 99.90/95, within the 10 basis point fee, adding that buying came mainly from sister banks in the Bank of China group. An official with one of the Chinese banks said the deal was launched at an effective yield of 7.26 pct, in line with the market at that time. But a European banker said pricing was not an issue IN the present market conditionS, ""the timing was just not right."" ""If banks had more patience they wouldn't launch any issues now, and then the market would be all right,"" another dealer said. ""But there is no reason to be overly pessimistic,"" he said.

Despite the criticism bankers said CDFC still managed to recruit more than 10 underwriters though the composition of the group has not yet been finalised. ""Any trader should recommend his bank against joining the deal,"" said a dealer. ""But there are other considerations such as relationship."" He admitted his bank has joined as co-manager. A banker said he saw no reason why the market makers decided to shut down if they were willing to join the new issue. ""Perhaps they were jealous that for the first time a Chinese entity has taken the sole lead position for a Chinese issue,"" he said. Previously Chinese entities have always acted as co-lead managers, whether for Chinese or foreign issues. REUTER "

Hughes Tool Co said its board has appointed a committee to search for a chief operating officer in the event that it does not complete its merger with Baker International Corp BKO>.

The post of chief operating officer is now vacant at Hughes. Chairman W.A. Kistler Jr. is chief executive officer. Hughes said it proposed to Baker that the companies ask the Justice Department to allow them to proceed with the merger on condition that they find a buyer approved by the Department for the domestic oilfield tricine rock bit assets of Baker's Reed subsidiary, its Singapore plant and Baker Lift's domestic electrical submersible pump business by April 22, the last date the merger of Baker and Hughes could occur under their agreement.

Hughes said ""For reasons Hughes does not fully understand, Baker declined to proceed in this fashion and insisted that it would proceed only if Hughes signed the consent decree.""

OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran""s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar""s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers. Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd. Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes from the U.K. North Sea.

The U.S. economy is facing several serious problems which threaten its continued expansion, according to a Congressional report released today. The report by the Democratic majority of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee said the outlook was for sluggish growth in the U.S. and the rest of the world for the near future. Committee Republicans released a separate, more optimistic report predicting continued stable growth with low inflation. Democrats have a 12 to eight majority on the committee, which is made up of 10 Senators and 10 Representatives. ""The annual report of the committee surveys a 3.7 trillion dlr economy whose tranquil appearance obscures the danger signals that lie just below the surface,"" Committee chairman Sen. Paul Sarbanes said in a statement. ""A close inspection of the economy reveals that the current recovery, while long, is fragile, and we are skating on thin ice,"" the Maryland Democrat said. He said the danger signals included a decline in investment, increased demand for borrowing which was straining the financial system, a possible increase in inflation fueled by higher oil prices and the depressed condition of the nation's farmers. Republicans said most private economists saw no likelihood of a recession and were predicting a growth rate of around three pct for this year and next, similar to Administration forecasts. ""The economy appears to be on a path of stable growth. We're comfortable with the current low rate of inflation, hopeful that interest rates will continue to decline, optimistic that employment opportunities will continue to improve and confident in this nation's resilient, innovative and diversified economy,"" the Republican report said. ""The greatest economic challenge facing the 100th Congress is reducing the federal deficit,"" the Republicans added. Democrats said the budget deficit should be reduced but also wanted the government to spend more on education, job training, research and development and health care. They said pressures on the dollar might make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy if this becomes necessary. ""There is now substantial concern about the inflationary effects of a declining dollar and the buildup of monetary pressure arising from the recent rapid growth in the money supply,"" the Democrat report said. ""At the same time, the increased reliance on foreign sources of capital in American investment markets means that the Federal Reserve can no longer be as aggressive as in the past in lowering interest rates and driving the dollar down."" ""Taken together, the outlook for fiscal and monetary policy is thus not very encouraging,"" the Democrats said. The Democrats called on the Administration to be more aggressive in removing foreign trade barriers and in seeking new initiatives to solve the international debt problem. The Democrats said much of the U.S. trade deficit had been caused by misalignment of the world's currencies, especially the overvaluation of the dollar that began in 1982. Both Democrats and Republicans called for policies to increase American productivity including incentives for saving and investment in plant and equipment and development of a better educated work force.

House Speaker Jim Wright is lobbying congressmen to support a plan to cut the 1988 budget deficit about 40 billion dlrs, half through spending cuts and the remainder through tax hikes, congressional sources said. He is backing a half and half plan and has made the suggestion to Democrats on the House Budget Committee privately, committee sources said. However, a committee source told Reuters that committee Democrats already generally favor a plan to cut the deficit about 40 billion dlrs, half through taxes and the Speaker's move was seen as building support outside the committee. Wright's 20 billion dlr revenue raising plan has no specifics, although he has floated a stock transfer tax and also has suggested deferring tax cuts due to the wealthy. Neither of those plans has caught fire yet in Congress, and some congressmen are cool to the idea of a stock tax. The Budget committee is considering a 1988 budget aimed at reducing the estimated deficit of 170 billion dlrs as estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Committee Chairman William Gray has publicly backed a budget cutting move of 40 billion dlrs but says that will not reach the Gramm-Rudman deficit target for 1988 of 108 billion dlrs, although he claims it will be in the spirit of it.

Enzon Inc said a new treatment using its investigational new drug PEG-ADA has restored the functioning of the immune system in the first two children that were born deficient in the enzyme adenosine deaminase. The disorder is known as severe combined immunodeficiency disease, or ""bubble boy disease"" Bubble Boy Disease is a rare but severe disease that hampers the development of the immune system. It has killed most of its victims before adulthood. Children with the disease are consigned to live in a sterile environment, such as a plastic bubble, to avoid infection, the company said. The study of Enzon's drug, conducted at Duke University, showed that two children suffering from the disease were treated for 11 and seven months, respectively, and were free of serious infection during that time, the company said. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The disease is caused by a missing enzyme, called Adenosine Deaminase, or ADA, that is crucial to the development of the immune system. Enzon said it has developed a technology to coat the enzyme with a substance called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, serving to disguise the enzyme when it is reintroduced into the body, preventing rejection. ""Marked improvement in laboratory tests of immune function occurred in each child, along with an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes, the immune cells that were missing before treatment with PEG-ADA had begun,"" the study said. ""The children are now more active and have begun to gain weight and height. Before treatment their growth had been very poor in comparison to normal children of the same age,"" the study, conducted by Doctors Michael Hershfield and Rebecca Buckley, said. The PEG-ADA injections were given once a week. Victims of the disease have traditionally been treated by bone marrow transplants, but for most, donors are not available or transplantation is unsuccessful, the company said. Other diseases caused by a missing enzyme might also be treated by introducing a PEG coated enzyme, the article noted. Reuter "

Congressional ire is rising against the multinational development banks which make loans to help other countries produce goods in direct competition with beleagured U.S. farmers and miners. With a record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year and a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressing to hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other development banks if the money is used to subsidize production or to produce goods already in oversupply around the world. ""American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct competition with our producers,"" Senator Don Nickles, an Oklahoma Republican, said in a letter to fellow senators seeking support for his legislation to limit these loans. Nickles and Senator Steven Symms, a conservative Republican from Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly limit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus commodities or minerals. Current law requires that the United States vote against such loans but carries no reprisals if they are ultimately approved by the banks. Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S. policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised at two Senate committee hearings last week. Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign Operations, ""As a policy matter, we oppose loans for production of commodities in oversupply."" The senators cited a 350-mln-dlr World Bank loan made to Argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989. Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans such as a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at low interest rates for agriculture. Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three times over the objections of the administration to cut U.S. funding of development banks by the amount of these loans. But even with a 65 to 15 vote in favour of the proposal, the restrictions were weakened in the final version. Only a provision directing U.S. officials to vote disapproval cleared Congress. This year's version, called the Foreign Agricultural Investment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote against loans designed to increase production of surplus commodities and minerals. Also, the recipient countries would have to prove that the production, marketing and export of the commodities could be handled without government subsidy. If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the United States would not increase or replenish funds for that institution until it agrees to stop making such loans. Objections to such loans have most often been raised by conservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S. funding for these international development banks. But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised similar concerns among more moderate senators. The administration opposes any legislation that would tie its hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be instances in which a country needed the money to continue its moves toward U.S. policies in other areas. Baker said the United States would continue to use its leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization measures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies. Two House Republicans, Representatives Larry Craig of Idaho and Beau Bolter of Texas, have introduced the bill. But it faces stiff opposition in the House Banking Committee which has blocked its consideration by the House in the past. Symms intends to offer the bill as an amendment to any related legislation this year, an aide said. Reuter "

[u'earn', u'crude', u'uk', u'usa']|"ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL U.S. EARNINGS SHARPLY LOWER

Royal Dutch/Shell Group RD.AS> earnings for 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market conditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due to different accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said. The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year, while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg. The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, with lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by volume. Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at the top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading Plc SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg from a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a general collapse in exploration and production volumes was partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln stg from 205 mln in 1985. Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter results, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding forecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete Wedd noted. However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in performance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986. The impact of recovering oil prices would come through faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year lag, analysts said. Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all. Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in the period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group had increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes added. Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue U.S. Exploration activity. ""Exploration is currently pretty flat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no massive upturn,"" he said. A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel. Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. ""If you are not exploring you are not going to find anything,"" he noted. U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day (bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed below 20 dlrs a barrel. This favored OPEC's attempts to stabilise prices, as the lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC marginal production shutting down. ""OPEC has done pretty extraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,"" he added. Reuter "

[u'interest', u'spain']|"BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE

Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity. The central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets. Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth. ""I think it's a good measure,"" a senior foreign banker said. ""It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy."" ""It shows that the political will is very strong. They know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run,"" he added. The head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates. But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish exports less competitive. The government says industry's competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the European Community, which it joined a year ago. To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough sacrifices. Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose demands essentially involve more government spending, have become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can. Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard. The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct. Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months. The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and, inevitably, push lending rates higher. A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates. REUTER "

Officials and diplomats said EC farm ministers, who earlier this week ended another marathon negotiating session, achieved more than ever before in the fight to end food surpluses, and delighted EC officials are now preparing to carry the reform offensive into other areas. Their immediate aim is to drain the wine and olive oil ""lakes"" and level the ""grain mountain"" that have brought the Community so much unwelcome publicity. Earlier this week, ministers finally agreed after 36 hours of negotiations the fine details of an outline accord to cut milk output by 9.5 pct over two years and reduce butter stocks, now at a record 1.2 mln tonnes. Officials said new rules, which place strict limits on farmers' rights to benefit from high subsidised prices, could be expected to reduce sales into intervention to a trickle and pave the way for reform in other surplus sectors. The deal was reached despite determined attempts at backsliding by some states as the implications of the original outline accord reached last December began to sink in. ""Despite coming under tremendous pressure, the ministers never wavered from the main features of the deal,"" one senior official said, adding the result augured well for talks later this month on other reforms. The Commission is leading the fight against food surpluses and has now proposed the most severe annual price review, at which ministers fix farm support prices, in the EC's history. Most prices would be cut or frozen, new quality standards enforced, and most farmers' rights to sell to intervention curtailed. Officials say the measures could lead to effective price cuts for some low quality cereals of eight to 11 pct.

Congressional ire is rising against the multinational development banks which make loans to help other countries produce goods in direct competition with beleagured American farmers and miners. With a record trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year and a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressing to hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other development banks if the money is used to subsidize production or to produce goods already in oversupply around the world. ""American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct competition with our producers,"" Sen. Don Nickles, an Oklahoma Republican, said in a letter to fellow senators seeking support for his legislation to limit these loans. Nickles and Sen. Steven Symms, a conservative Republican from Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly limit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus commodities or minerals. Current law requires the United States to vote against such loans but carries no reprisals if they pass anyway. Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S. policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised at two Senate committee hearings last week. Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign Operations, ""as a policy matter, we oppose loans for production of commodities in oversupply."" The senators cited a 350 mln dlr World Bank loan made to Argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989. Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans such as a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at low interest rates for agriculture. Baker said the Argentine loan was ""really the only one you can point to and criticize."" Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three times over the objections of the administration to cut U.S. funding of development banks by the amount of these loans. Even with a favorable vote of 65 to 15, the restrictions were weakened in the final version. Only a provision directing U.S. officials to vote disapproval was enacted into law. This year's proposal, called the Foreign Agricultural Investment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote against loans designed to increase production of surplus commodities and minerals. Also, the recipient countries would have to prove that the production, marketing and export of the commodities could be handled without government subsidy. If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the United States would not increase or replenish funds for that institution until it agrees to stop making such loans. Objections to such loans have most often been raised by conservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S. funding for these international development banks. But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised similar concerns among more moderate senators. Democratic senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland told Baker at the Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, ""Many say the banks are financing competition for American jobs."" She recommended that the United States use its participation in debt forgiveness for developing country loans as a wedge to open markets to U.S. goods. The administration opposes any legislation that would tie its hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be instances in which a country needed the money to continue its moves toward U.S. policies in other areas. Baker said the United States would continue to use its leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization measures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies. Reuter "

French official reserves fell 45.06 billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from 421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the European Monetary System (EMS). Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs during the month, the ministry said. This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund, counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM). But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a result of using very short-term financing instruments. The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the franc. On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency. The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves to 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74 billion at end December. Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.

Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following this week's breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas, President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster said. He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country's export target to ICO-member countries. The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added. It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said. Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy, but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions. ""We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause markets to panic,"" Dauster added. He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement. ""Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does not need an ICO agreement as a crutch,"" Dauster said. Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two mln bags in Brazil's export quotas. ""It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover,"" he said. The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas, he said. Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries. Close links would continue with these producers, particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present. He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of roaster buying contracts, although ""no hypothesis has been abandoned."" Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for May shipment coffee will be opened. He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as some exporters had suggested. He noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11.2 mln and 12 mln bags. He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate until late April. Reuter "

Britain appeared set for a new cash row with its European Community partners as evidence emerged that it could be much worse off as a result of new proposals to radically alter the way the EC is financed. Analysis by officials and diplomats of proposals released yesterday by the EC's executive Commission showed their full impact, were they in force this year, would have left Britain worse off by 545 mln European Currency Units. The proposals have to be agreed unanimously by member government after a debate expected to open next month. The Commission said they were necessary to prevent the EC from sliding once again into bankruptcy, and has described the current financing system as unfair and unacceptable. British dissatisfaction with the cost of EC membership has long been a source of friction, and diplomats said the proposals could well reopen the wound. This was despite a proposed correction of Britain's budget contribution to reflect its inability to take full advantage of the EC's farm subsidies system because of the relatively small size of its agricultural sector. Diplomats said although other nations such as Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands were certain to oppose elements in the system which could also substantially increase their own EC payments, the main opposition was expected from Britain. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has made clear in recent statements that she is not prepared to abandon the present system, under which Britain is refunded two-thirds of its net payments to the EC, unless a fairer system is devised. The diplomats said Thatcher was unlikely to consider the proposed system as fair. The Commission's proposals would base a state's contribution on its gross national product, which the commission says is a fairer measurement reflecting relative wealth. The main element of the previous system was a share of value added tax collected in member states. The mechanism to compensate Britain for its inability to take up a higher proportion of EC farm expenditure will have to be paid for by the other 11 states. The Commission has also proposed to end repayments to all states of a service charge paid to them for collecting customs duties on behalf of the EC. REUTER "

""Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations have become easy prey,"" Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, the chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the start of a hearing on SEC activities. ""Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come,"" Markey said. ""The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania is particularly distressing."" Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high fines and disbarment from the securities industry. ""Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing through to legitimate investors and traders,"" Shad said in his statement.

Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought the tender offer process needed reform including earlier disclosure of takeover attempts. N.J. Rep.

Commission members would be appointed by the SEC.

The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25. The official gave no figure for February output.

[u'finland']|"FINNISH TAXATION MAJOR ISSUE IN ELECTION CAMPAIGN

Personal taxation has emerged as the major economic issue in Finnish general elections later this month, and Conservative gains could mark a shift towards indirect taxation and accelerate moves towards more market-oriented banking practices, economists say. Opinion polls indicate the Conservative Party, Finland's second largest, may gain enough clout after the elections to join a coalition government which is still likely to be dominated by the Social Democrats of Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa. But the economists point out that Conservative economic policies differ only slightly from the governments', and that trade with the Soviet Union will not be affected. Helsinki bankers said a new government, including the Conservatives for the first time in 20 years, could bring about a shift from direct to indirect taxation. The present coalition of Social democrats and Centrists has embarked on a tax reform programme to cut marginal taxation, which is up to 75 pct in the highest income scales. The opposition has also called for reforms, but they differ over how to regain lost state revenues. One Conservative favoured possibility is abolishing tax exemption on interest from bank deposits and government bonds. Hannu Halttunen, of Helsinki bank Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), told Reuters ""We want to be more free in setting interest rates and in creating different deposits to suit the individual investors. If tax on interest is introduced, then we prefer a system with taxation of real interest gains."" Under present laws, bank customers are exempted from tax on interest when banks jointly set interest rates. Bankers said this had encouraged cartel-style banking and was hindering tougher inter-bank competition. A London-based Nordic banking expert said liberalisation was too strong a word to use in a Finnish context, but a Conservative presence could dislodge traditional practices. ""It would probably result in new practices that have been seen elsewhere for a few years growing rather more quickly in Finland,"" he said, in a reference to money market instruments. All parties, especially the Conservatives, have been careful to avoid making Finnish-Soviet trade an election issue. Moscow is Finland's largest trading partner. Until a few years ago the Conservative Party was seen as anti-communist, but has now moderated its stance, political analysts say. Trade between Helsinki and Moscow is based on a barter system, and is balanced under long-term accords. In January the two countries signed a 1987 agreement worth 30 billion markka, but trade in the past two years has been declining due to the fall in the price of crude oil, which accounts for 80 pct of Finnish imports from the Soviet Union. The bankers said taxation had become the major economic theme of the campaign because there were few other issues. Inflation was 3.4 pct in 1986, compared with 5.9 pct in 1985, and unemployment has increased slightly from 6.1 pct of the workforce in 1985 to last year's levels of 6.7 pct. The Social democrats in 1986 doubled the country's foreign trade surplus compared with 1985, from 2.50 billion markka to 5.04 billion markka. Opinion polls say Sorsa's Social Democrats will remain the largest party in the 200-seat Parliament, with some 26 pct of the vote. They currently hold 57 seats. The Centre Party, the other major coalition partner, is also expected to hold on to its 37 seats. But increased Conservative support and a decline for the Communists could make force Sorsa to allow the Conservatives into government. They currently hold 44 seats. REUTER "

A study of salmonella poisoning has uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that can infect humans and resist medicines. Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote the growth of cattle. Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs. Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect humans. But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans. The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant infection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to 298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized for their illness. They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always prevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating raw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, ""the majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating hamburger that was at least partially cooked."" The researchers said the results show that ""food animals are a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections in humans, and that these infections are associated with (antibiotic) use on farms.""

Leaks of a major Dutch official economic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this year, political and market sources say. Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness this year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage increase, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth. But whatever the government's response, the central bank will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say. The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB) publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and the economy. Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch economic growth was now seen around one pct. Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar, Pierson said in its February economic outlook. The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of 2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September. The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990. Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder. Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised the guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark in last January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness. But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment. Some analysts also question the central bank's decision not to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge. Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on the money market, noting ""the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already far below the market rates."" Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest rate policies serve that goal. Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold to take profits. Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment. Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder. Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first. One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down to reduce the government debt burden. A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between the ministry and the central bank. ""The cabinet's policy is steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark,"" he said. REUTER "

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>, earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter ended January 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than last year's 697.0 mln dlrs. However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of provisioning for loan losses established last year because of many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31. The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5 mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.

Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to 213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions, non-interest expenses and income taxes. The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92 billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields. Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100 dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986, but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter. The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4 billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion dlrs.

[u'interest', u'uk']|"BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT

The Bank of England again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high. It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said. Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want to. The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage. ""They're really making the discount houses suffer,"" said Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew. ""Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates."" This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came strongly into the pound. The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50. ""If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget,"" said Jeremy Hale, economist at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp. Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow. However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains. There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co. Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, Fellner said. An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most forecasts say it will be this year. Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar. However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether. The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there. Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan. They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington. The Bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. ""But by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of England,"" he added. The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders. Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg. This was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985. Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals. The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half or full point about Budget day. REUTER "

[u'poland']|"POLISH TRADE OFFICIAL CALLS FOR FREER MARKET

Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Janusz Kaczurba told Reuters that Poland would have to diverge from traditional Communist bloc centrally-planned economic policies if it wanted to bring about economic renewal and compete in world markets. Stressing his commitment to a series of reforms recently introduced to streamline the economy and boost export-oriented industry, he also called for an expansion in the role of the private sector. Asked whether the policies the government was advocating did not represent a departure from the strictly controlled economic model within the Soviet bloc, he said in an interview with Reuters ""I don't see any alternative but to try to proceed along the lines of economic reasoning."" He referred specifically to bankruptcies, which he said would be ""the logical outcome of a more stringent economic policy,"" once the state stopped propping up enterprises to guarantee jobs, regardless of how inefficient they were. He added, ""We should follow the policy of creating a system whereby managers will be really responsible for the overall economic effect of enterprises. This can be done in one way only, through the reduction of subsidies."" But he also noted the need to curtail bureaucracy of branch ministries, allow domestic prices to reflect the world market, make foreign exchange rates more realistic, provide incentives to export-oriented industry and encourage private business. Kaczurba was talking to Reuters about the effect on the economy of U.S. Sanctions imposed in 1982 in response to the suppression of the Solidarity trade union under martial law. He acknowledged that Poland's economic decline would add to its problems in trying to regain markets and support from Western creditors even after Washington lifted remaining restrictions and restored Most Favoured Nation trading status last month. Western officials say Polish goods have to be more competitive and of better quality in the face of trade wars and protectionism amongst U.S., Japanese and European competitors. Reaffirming the government's view that the key to solving some of those problems and meeting payments on a 33.5 billion dlr foreign debt lay in increasing hard currency exports, Kaczura said private enterprise could play a greater role. ""I think we could have some 20,000 small private enterprises active in export-oriented business if such operators are successfully convinced that the policy towards the (private) sector is stabilised,"" he said. Poland already has a more developed private sector than most other East European countries. Among economic reforms already under way, Kaczurba listed easier access to hard currency profits, tax incentives, access to investment credits and two devaluations of the zloty to increase competitivity of prices. He said such policies had been welcomed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, through which Poland is hoping to gain new credits, but Poles were caught in a ""vicious circle."" Creditors wanted proof that the policies were directed towards improving exports, but in order to fulfil their expectations Poland first needed fresh inputs, he said. REUTER "

Earlier today newspapers in Turkey carried an advertisement from Turkish Sugar Factories inviting offers of 100,000 tonnes of crystal sugar with a 50 pct option to increase or decrease the amount.

""Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is good for both companies,"" Kistler said of the proposed merger that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service company. ""We're working very hard on this merger."" Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11 to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal. The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to terminate the proposed merger. The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree. The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state court to force to Hughes to complete the merger. ""The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous about what the outcome might be,"" Kistler said, in explaining why Hughes had made the counter proposal. ""We need additional time to understand why Baker did not accept our proposal."" Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker ""was not a factor"" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal on the table. He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit. Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific. The Justice Department in January said it would block the Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide for the sale of the assets after the merger took place. The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because its was too ""unreasonable."" Hughes said that Baker should instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the merger is finalized and given government approval. Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for finding a buyer. Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take up to 10 years to complete the sales. He also expressed concern that the combined companies might be required by the government's conditions to license some of its technology to any purchaser of the assets. Baker said last night in a statement that the required assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs, representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined companies. Reuter "

SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland. Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs. Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said. SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160 mln this year and 159 mln in 1985. SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight, giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal. The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a regional operation, Geronimus said. He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around 30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share reserved for foreign investors.

""I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls in April this year,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb. Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence.

In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an especially soft February last year which was adversely affected by severe weather.

""February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to tax reductions,"" said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.

A reduction of the U.S. federal budget deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge trade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said. Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Yeutter said ""Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now. ""Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the trade deficit down."" He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits. Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S. budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser extent, other U.S. securities as well. ""We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go,"" Yeutter said. He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and the establishment of a ""level playing field"" for trade. The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down. On the fiscal side, Yeutter said ""the budget deficit is still our biggest problem"" and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit. In the international area, he said that ""our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth."" Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said ""Japan is just not doing the job on the import side."" Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner. In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued. ""The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the end,"" Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S. trade deficit, ""the dollar will be the equalizer."" Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers. He said ""there's relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem."" Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said. ""There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation,"" Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems.

The highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said. The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely. ""You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza,"" he said. On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms. ""The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg,"" said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems. ""This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge,"" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. ""If you want my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again,"" he said.

Australia accused the U.S. of increasing protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to Washington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules on agricultural trade. Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver. ""Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by actions which in fact increased protection in trade in agriculture,"" the Australian delegation said in a statement. ""The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture,"" Arnott told the meeting. Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a justification for ""dubious protective measures"" by the U.S. He listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to close the U.S. sugar market to imports. He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic support programs. This covered imports of dairy products, peanuts, cotton and sugar. Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the GATT, told Reuters: ""These charges have been made since the very beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural policy, part of our law when we joined the GATT"". ""We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with their programs. We can negotiate them all,"" Samuels added.

Volkswagen AG VOWG.F> expects currency factors to cause a further drop in its U.S. Sales in 1987 following a 5.2 pct sales decline in the United States in 1986, board member Karl-Heinz Briam said. Briam, who described the current situation of the U.S. Market as critical, also said VW was uncertain whether it would be able in 1987 to fully match its record 1986 European sales. In 1986 the VW group, which includes Audi AG NSUG.F>, delivered a record 981,000 vehicles to European markets outside of West Germany, a rise of 5.1 pct against 1985, Briam told a regular quarterly meeting of the Wolfsburg plant's workforce. Briam said sales conditions in Europe had generally become more difficult in 1987 because of weaker growth rates and fiercer competition in the region. Briam gave no forecast for VW domestic sales. But he said car sales in West Germany for all manufacturers combined would probably fall by a slight three to four pct from 1986's record 2.73 mln because car sales in West Germany had likely passed their peak for this business cycle. Summing up his predictions, Briam said limits to growth were becoming apparent on the VW group's most important markets but there were no grounds for great worries. The automobile industry, as far as VW was concerned, had entered its fourth consecutive good year, with VW's incoming orders and sales remaining favourable overall, he said. Briam, who is VW's director of labour relations, also said VW currently had no plans for further increases in its workforce. He told the plant's workforce that an internationally-active company like VW must be able to adjust to changed economic conditions and manage situations in which unfavourable currency relations restrict its room for financial maneuver. Briam said VW needed to hold and expand market share in order to overcome its cost disadvantages compared with some of its foreign competitors, particularly those in the Far East. This could only be done if capital-intensive plants were used as fully as possible, if the workers' qualifications were raised through comprehensive training and if working hours were arranged so that expensive production plants operated as efficiently and soundly as possible. The metalworkers union IG Metall has said it plans to push for a 35-hour working week in its sector of West Germany industry this year. Walter Hiller, the chairman of VW's works council, told the same Wolfsburg meeting that a cut in the working week to 35 hours was necessary to help reduce unemployment. He said the works council was prepared to negotiate on making working hours more flexible to suit the needs of both the company and the workforce. A seven-week strike by IG Metall in the summer of 1984 for a 35-hour week in the West German metal industry ended in a compromise that cut hours to 38.5 hours but also allowed each company in the industry to decide, in consultation with the workforce, how the reductions should be made.

[u'grain', u'wheat', u'usa']|"HOUSE 0/92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE

A House Agriculture Committee meeting later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or ""de-coupling,"" provision to cover feedgrains, and those who oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources said. The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year 0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments. The administration has strongly urged that the bill be expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year. It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision will emerge from the committee, the sources said. Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs. Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of the bill, committee staffers said. The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week. Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30. Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be implemented, an Agriculture Department source said. An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was necessary. Major commodity groups, including the National Corn Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92. But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it should be extended to other crops. There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash. Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said. Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major changes in the farm bill. ""Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the timing,"" a congressional staff member said. Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988 feedgrains. Reuter "

Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for USAir Group U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc, which was being courted by USAir. Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc TWA> made a 1.4 billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to accepting the bid. Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment. Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread it would be taken over. Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged. ""The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or Piedmont and USAir announce a deal,"" speculated one arbitrager. Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will succeed. Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk Southern Corp NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance. Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the least likely to be bought. Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont. But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with contingencies. Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA. ""You can't discount him,"" said one arbitrager. Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price if USAir rejected his offer. ""It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing,"" said one arbitrager. Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by about six dlrs per share. Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but others believe it could be cleared if the companies are acquired separately. ""TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to work,"" said one analyst. Analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions. In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity, analysts said. Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines' costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a necessary ingredient for a merger to work. However, other analysts speculated the managements of Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged into TWA. Reuter "

Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices. Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. ""We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,"" he said. ""I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work,"" he said. Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures. Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said; ""That could well be correct."" Opec""s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was ""well below"" its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures. But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd. The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd. Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1. Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said. Lukman said that some industry reports ""may be correct"" that in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota. He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States"" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude. However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks. ""We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals,"" he said, adding that he expected it to go ""up and up"" even beyond official prices after early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria""s. The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products. Also, some of Venezuela""s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said. Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to ""dangerous levels,"" they would eventually have to buy Opec oil. ""When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on,"" he said. Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak. He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment. ""At this time, we have to get our priorities right,"" he said. ""The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades."" But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said. Reuter "

Top U.S. and European farm trade and government representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance. Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production. ""It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful,"" U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Administrator William Bailey said. Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment. The need for urgent reforms is justified by the ""imbalance and tensions of the world economy,"" the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Jean-Claude Paye said. And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he noted. Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas. Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses. Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices. However, ""differentiated policy treatment is required"" to take account of large disparities in the situation around the EC, he said. ""Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the Community,"" he said. Reuter "

Venezuela's recent agreement with its creditor banks reprograms six billion dlrs of its 21 billion dlr public sector foreign debt rescheduling and reduces repayments due between 1987 and 1992, Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua said. Azpurua was commenting in a television interview on Friday's agreement to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over Libor from 1-1/8 pct and extend the period to 14 years from 12-1/2. He said in addition to the reduction in amortizations over the next three years sought by the government, agreed at 1.35 billion dlrs instead of 3.335 billion, Venezuela will also pay less in the subsequent three years. The accord runs till 1999. Azpurua said that in 1990, payments of restructured debt are lowered to 1.05 billion dlrs from 1.339 mln, to 1.25 billion from 1.994 mln in 1991 and to 1.45 billion from 2.403 billion in 1992. He said the contingency clause implemented by Venezuela soon after the original rescheduling was signed in February 1986 stays in effect and that the new payment schedule is based on an assumption of oil prices varying between 15 and 18 dlrs a barrel. Venezuela, hit by a 40 pct drop in oil income last year, had sought a direct link between repayments and the level of oil income, but banks resisted on the grounds this could create a dangerous precedent for other Latin American debtors. Azpurua said the new terms have been telexed to Venezuela's 450 creditor banks for acceptance with information on government plans to draw up debt capitalization rules and return to the capital markets. Public finances director Jorge Marcano said the government plans to issue dollar, mark and yen denominated bonds this year for amounts varying between 100 and 150 mln dlrs.

House Majority leader Thomas Foley (D-Wash.) has urged Congress to give the farm credit system a few more months to reorganize itself before rushing into a federal rescue of the system, a senior aide to Foley said. Gene Moos, agricultural aide to the Majority leader, told Reuters while Foley believes action will be necessary later this year to rescue the system, a bail-out package is not necessarily needed immediately. Foley's view appears to differ with the Senate leadership who have said they hope to have farm credit legislation under consideration before Congress breaks for Easter April 9. Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) chairman of the Senate Agriculture subcommittee responsible for the farm credit issue, last week pledged to consider a bill before Easter. Boren said his subcommittee would proceed even if neither the system's regulator, the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) nor the system itself ask for aid. Chairman of the FCA Frank Naylor, like Foley, has expressed caution about rushing to a bail-out, prefering to wait a few months and keep pressure on the system to reform itself, farm credit sources said. ""He (Foley) is willing to give Mr. Naylor some time in this regard,"" Moos said. Moos predicted Congress will begin serious action on a rescue package sometime this summer. Any package of legislation is unlikely to include large federal outlays of money, he said.

Corn sales gained 2,494,900 tonnes in the week ended February 26, the highest weekly total since August 1984 and two and three-quarter times the prior week's level, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department said sales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reported under the daily reporting system -- were the first sales for delivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR Grains Supply Agreement, which began October 1. Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and sales to unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes. Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and 151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half from the previous week's combined sales, it said. Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers for delivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by 30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1. Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled the preceding week, but were nearly a third below the four week average. Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexico and Italy, it said. Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4 times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct less than the four week average. Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown destinations. Soybean oil sales of 5,400 tonnes were the result of increases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes for unknown destinations. Combined sales activity in cotton of 75,200 running bales -- 44,700 bales for the current year and 30,500 bales for the 1987/88 bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week's good showing, the department said. Major purchasers for the current season were South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Thailand, while South Korea and Indonesia were the major buyers for the 1987/88 season, which begins August 1. Reuter "

[u'acq', u'usa']|"HUGHES HT> CHANGES STANCE ON MERGER AFTER SUIT

A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed Hughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a proposed merger with Baker International Corp BKO>, Wall Street analysts said. Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was off. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from Hughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said it was still interested in the merger. The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its troubles could make it a takeover candidate. There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas investor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters he is not interested. Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities and Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in some publicly traded company. He declined to identify the target other than to rule out Hughes. One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes turnabout was Borg-Warner Corp BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of Hughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the Hughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker. Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a merger, and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile, analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was going. ""I think the merger is not going through,"" said Phil Pace, analyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger ""lost a lot of its appeal"" when the U.S. Department of Justice required that Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation. Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of the total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said ""30 to 40 pct of the cost savings are tied up in that."" ""They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,"" said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ""Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but whether they will alter their position, I don't know. ""It's getting a little confusing,"" said James Carroll, analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited by Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger ""tend to be weak."" Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it wanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22, the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer period of time. Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the companies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale. Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling Reed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be saved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs. Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first signed ""the outlook for the industry has improved materially."" Hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry is lifting.

Garn told a Georgetown University conference on financial institutions that news reports that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp was technically in deficit were true and urged swift congressional action to strengthen the fund. Garn said his office received calls from individuals worried about the safety of their money. ""The runs have started,"" Garn, a member of the Banking Committee, said. Legislation to infuse more money into the fund which insures savings deposits was to be voted on today by the committee but was postponed because of last-minute differences. FSLIC has reserves of two billion dlrs but faces potential claims of 15 billion dlrs, Garn said. He said the claims would not come all at once, however, and dismissed any real danger to deposits at federally insured thrifts up to the insurance level of 100,000 dlrs. ""People's money is safe,"" Garn said, but he added, ""We need to quiet down the situation and put their fear to bed."" Garn said he and Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis) agree on the need for legislation but they differed over strategy. Garn opposes including other issues in the legislation and would prefer a bill that was limited to restoring FSLIC and giving regulators more power to cope with failing banks and thrifts. Proxmire's bill also would prohibit new so-called nonbank banks and thrifts which use a regulatory loophole to operate outside the usual legal limits on traditional banks. William Isaac, former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, told the conference that if that fund were combined with FSLIC they could have 29 billion dlrs and cover contingencies for both the bank and thrift industries. However, political differences make a merger of the two federal funds unlikely, Isaac, now president of the Secura Group, a consulting firm, said. By the 1990's the financial industry will include a handful of nationwide institutions offering every type of financial service which evolved from today's banks, nontraditional financial firms and industrial companies.

Key members of the House Agriculture committee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but a broader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later, Congressional sources said. The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn English (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop winter and spring wheat. This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987 wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat. Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still collect 92 pct of deficiency payments. Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill and 0/92. The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92, and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill. Congressional sources said there has not been enough time to study the implications of a broad 0/92. ""The timing (of the proposal) is off,"" said one aide to a House Agriculture committee member. However, several Congressional sources said they expect a broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part of an overall deficit reduction package. Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley (D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts may exceed one billion dlrs. A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration estimate it would result in significant budget savings. A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all 1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5 billion dlrs over five years. Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the approach of planting season, Congressional sources said. Some officials said it already is late for implementation of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for wheat and feedgrains. If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either would have to be extended or reopened, sources said. Reuter "

[u'usa']|"INTEREST IN OPTIONS STIRRED BY U.S. FARM PLANS

In their search for ways to cut spending on U.S. farm programs, policymakers and their advisers here are citing trading in options contracts as an alternative to federal income and price supports. Critics of costly federal farm programs maintain that the government could get out of guaranteeing minimum support prices if farmers systematically used options contracts to protect themselves against vacillating market prices. ""With agricultural options now available, there is less need for government price support programs to provide price stability for farmers,"" the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said in a recent position paper. ""Washington no longer needs to restrict the level and variability of commodity market prices. Farmers and others in agribusiness can now achieve the benefits of price stability by trading in option markets,"" the paper, written by Clemson University professor Kandice Kahl, said. Critics of farm programs contend that options offer the benefits of price support programs without entailing the cost to taxpayers. Kahl's paper urged farmers to buy ""put"" options in order to obtain the right to sell at a particular price to the private seller of the option contract. ""This gives the farmer a guaranteed price, but still allows him to profit from higher market prices, if they are available, by foregoing his option,"" Kahl said. Interest in promoting understanding of options trading among farmers also has been stirred in Congress by a proposed change in agricultural policy that would have the effect of exposing participants in federal farm programs to fluctuations in income subsidies. The proposal -- supported by the Reagan administration and a cross-section of lawmakers -- would allow farmers to receive at least 92 pct of their income subsidies regardless of how much they planted. Under current law, farmers enrolled in federal price stabilization programs receive income subsidies, or deficiency payments, equal to the difference between a set target price and the higher of the support price or market price. The so-called decoupling plan, or ""0/92"", would aim to curtail surplus production by eliminating the requirement that farmers plant in order to receive deficiency payments. Critics of ""0/92"" plan contend that if the scheme succeeded in curbing surplus output, market prices would rise and deficiency payments fall -- leaving farmers who chose not to plant with shrunken income subsidies and no crops to sell. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), who has been in the forefront of efforts to decouple income support from acreage plantings, advocates replacing the variable deficiency payment with a fixed and gradually declining payment. But many farm state lawmakers are turned off by the idea of offering fixed subsidies to farmers who plant nothing. Some congressional staff members said they are intrigued by the notion of having the federal government subsidize the purchase of ""call"" options to help farmers hedge their income risk. By buying a call option, the farmer would obtain the right to buy a commodity at a particular price. If the market price rose above that option price, the farmer could exercise the option and sell the commodity on the spot market, making up most of the reduction in the deficiency payment. An aide to Boschwitz said the senator might offer legislation linking options and decoupling, but that it might have to await the results of a pilot project on futures and options trading mandated by the 1985 farm bill. The bill required USDA, in association with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to conduct a pilot program in at least 40 counties which produce major program crops. The program, only recently launched, was designed to encourage producers to participate in futures and options markets and to ensure that producers' net returns would not fall below the county loan level for the crops in question.

Brazil's recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987. The developing world's most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said. ""That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation,"" Aldo Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics, said. Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets, but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable. ""Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates,"" Roldan said. The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs. But he added: ""They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels."" Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance. Negotiations between International Coffee Organization (ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence. ""Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations, which others wanted changed,"" one senior coffee dealer said. The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer. Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the dealer said. ""If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,"" he said. New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit. President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas. Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. ""They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,"" according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop. ""Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can't afford to store the crops,"" he said. The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields. ""We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,"" Loewy said. Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean Association (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year. Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather. Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said. He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan. ""We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are starting to harvest and starting to export,"" Eshleman said. But he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently. Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation. He said the debt situation was a major consideration. ""The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage,"" he added. Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said it would not make a big difference. On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital. Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which could limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will give it little room to stretch exports, they said. Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of surplus. ""Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it,"" one analyst said. ""If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would collapse and they can't afford to do that,"" she added. Reuter "

A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest monthly oil market report.

Contracts for Saudi crude have been signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required liftings. The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on Iranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2 mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices apparently cut February production. It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and 0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd. The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and 47.0 mln in the fourth quarter. The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids (ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other developing countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal) and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains.

[u'money-supply', u'usa']|"U.S. MONEY GROWTH SLOWS SHARPLY, ECONOMISTS SAY

U.S. money supply growth is slowing down rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the Federal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even have contracted in February. A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the Fed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid growth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy was justified on account of weakness in the economy. M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported today, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs. The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs. M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3. With other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit accounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is set for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say. M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of falling interest rates and banking deregulation. But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is likely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. ""The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're all sending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows at the Fed,"" McCarthy said. Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, ""We have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It's coming in a lot weaker than I thought."" The economists were quick to caution that one month's data prove nothing, especially because money growth previously had been so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct rate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks. Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a slowdown in the business expansion. But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus. McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter progresses. ""Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as they were a month ago,"" he noted. He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct. Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct or less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national product for the first quarter proved to be weak. ""You'd certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past."" There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance sheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under way, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to solve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive trade deficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to close the trade gap, Brusca said ""I'm not prepared to be all that optimistic about the bond market.""

Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro last night concluded this week's tour of European capitals having gleaned little in the way of concrete support from governments for his country's attempts to find a radical solution to its debt payments crisis. However, banking sources noted the existence of considerable sympathy for Brazil's position among most of its commercial bank creditors, manifested in the widespread belief that adopting a hard line could only exacerbate the problems while patience might pave the way for an eventual reconciliation. Brazil on February 20 unilaterally suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks, followed by moves related to around 15 billion dlrs of bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions. The action had been preceded by a significant deterioration in Brazil's balance of payments situation in the final quarter of 1986, along with a marked acceleration in inflation. Reserves had dipped to below four billion dlrs. Funaro and central bank president Francisco Gros last week visited Washington to explain Brazil's move to government officials and agencies. This week they have sought official support in the U.K., France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. They have now decided to extend their tour, flying on Sunday to Tokyo to talk to government officials, with a possible visit to Canada before they return home. Funaro and Gros have so far confined their consultations to government representatives, believing that problems with Brazil's 109 billion dlr debt call for a political solution. However, banking sources noted that their attempts to enlist the support of European and U.S. Governments had been met almost unanimously with advice to talk first to banks. This counsel has been coupled with emphasis on the need for Brazil to present to creditors a convincing economic programme, with U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also recommending an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), advice which Funaro subsequently rejected flatly.

The filing comes one day after MCI Communications Corp said the firm will seek immediate deregulation of its principal long-distance competitor, ATT. Under the approach outlined in the filing, ATT would commit to continue providing basic long-distance services to all customers and to maintain uniform nationwide prices in all parts of the country unless granted regulatory approval to do otherwise. Specifically, ATT proposed that the FCC require the company to file tariffs for new interstate services and price changes that would go into effect within 14 days. In addition, the proposal calls for the reduction of the voluminous documentation ATT is required to file each time it introduces or changes long-distance services. The new proposal would place the burden on challengers to demonstrate that ATT's tariffs ""are unreasonable"". It would also require long-distance companies to submit periodic reports to help regulators monitor competition in the industry.

Momentum in th U.S. economy may be picking up given solid across-the board increases in the February U.S. employment report, economists said. U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February, twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a 319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 448,000 increase. ""Even if you look at January and February together, this is still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in the market,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation. Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much larger gains in February U.S. production and income than previously forecast. The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from 34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose 0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since November 1966, the Commerce Department said. ""The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7 pct,"" said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4 pct gain in January U.S. industrial production. Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour in February from 8.83 dlrs in January. ""Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means we'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis the wage and salary disbursement,"" he said. Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January. He said the February employment gains are consistent with his firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product growth forecast of 3.7 pct. Economists agreed that the employment data were negative for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy and no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either. ""This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider easing,"" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. ""It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,"" he said. ""If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so, but it's most likely they'll sit and wait."" ""The data have not been uniform,"" Stone added. ""Durable goods were weak in January and now employment is strong."" In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct, followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S. retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap widened to 14.8 billion dlrs. ""Things just aren't adding up,"" said Steve Slifer of Lehman Goverment Securities Inc. ""Consumer spending, capital spending, goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first quarter GNP growth of one pct,"" he said. ""The employment and production data point to a big inventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth."" Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000 in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery industries returning to work. Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains have resulted from an improving trade outlook. Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S. trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve in the first quarter. ""Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter, but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show that trade is improving,"" Benderley said. ""The economy is moving between extremes,"" he said. ""Some reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct."" A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater part of February's employment gain.

The French primary bond market is showing signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said. The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5. The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate, the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this week, dealers noted. The Bank of France's ""open market"" policy to regulate the money markets since December has been based on a floor and ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and seven day repurchase rates. For the moment the sentiment is of ""wait and see"" on rate cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said. Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of 11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily absorbed. The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12 billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said. Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity in the primary market at the moment despite competition from the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange. There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand - with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees. Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March 9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct. Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said. Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest focussed on the likely three next issues. These will include an expected four to five billion franc issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de Refinancement Hypothecaire.

The Belgian government, which introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year, has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is scope for further cuts in 1988. The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet. The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates. The team's report to the government praises last year's spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy perform ""better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in the 1980s."" However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the government has set itself for 1989. The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of GNP in 1986. The report says ""The most that can be afforded over the next few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of general Government."" It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the debt to GNP ratio before this is possible. ""Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions, we feel that your position would be stronger if you could decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988,"" the report adds. The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the government's determination to keep its currency strong and to curb inflation. It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986. It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in Belgian francs.

[u'interest', u'uk']|"BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES

This week's Bank of England resistance to strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in holding bank base rates at 11 pct. But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources said. Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day. Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19. A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting. Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. ""Even after this action over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking distance of that range,"" he said. Other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area. However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports. ""If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they are, what's to stop it (going higher),"" said John Cox, executive director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London foreign exchange market. Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped keep it below 1.60 dlrs. The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and 1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting. But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels. He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat. ""If rates don't come down, the market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling,"" he said. Most dealers agree there is a good deal of ""hot money"" being invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short notice. However, the authorities will hope that at least a proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment. ""The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and have to jack them back up again,"" said Richard Jeffrey, economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd. He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling, at least in the near term. However, most analysts are still looking for a full point about March 17, Budget Day. The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the Budget, said Temperton. The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current bullishness in the government bond and currency markets. ""Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget. He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut,"" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the equities arm of Mercury International Group. Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind. This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11 3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October. However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates. REUTER "

The central bank gave its approval and said financial groups should be allowed to have banking subsidiaries as long as the groups did not include industrial or trading companies. The central bank was commenting on a proposed new bill governing Swedish financial groups. It recommended that insurance companies should not be allowed to own banks until a separate inquiry into the problem was completed. Sweden's two biggest insurance companies have both said they would like to enter the banking business. Sweden's commercial banks on the other hand have long wanted to buy up insurance companies. Bankers said the recommendations would mainly bring the rules up to date with new circumstances created by the extensive de-regulation of the Swedish financial markets since 1982. Bankers said it was clear that others would follow the Proventus example and that this would lead to a shake-up in the banking system with the remaining small regional banks being absorbed by larger banking groups.

Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release of ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance, notably in the securities business. He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10 share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock. News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders. Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and ABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said. Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986 by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1 pct to 242 mln guilders, he added. Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings margins via traditional lending activities, he said.

Standard and Poor's Corp said it expects downgrades of corporate debt ratings to ease this year from the lofty levels of 1986 and 1985. However, the rating agency said upgrades will probably stay at about the same level as in the past few years. The narrowing of the gap between downgrades and upgrades would reflect a calming in takeover frenzy, less volatile energy markets and slow but steady economic growth, S and P said. In particular, S and P expects that the industrial and banking sectors would have a less turbulent year than in 1986. S and P noted that 60 pct of 1986's downgrades were concentrated in the industrial sector, where the most negative factor was takeover fever that led to debt-financed mergers and acquisitions and costly defenses to fend off takeovers. It said takeovers appear to be on the decline this year. While S and P noted that the energy markets have stabilized after last year's collapse, it stressed that 1987 would not mark a turnaround for this industry. In addition, S and P does not expect any big shocks to hit the junk bond market this year, especially of the magnitude of 1986's unexpected LTV Corp LTV> bankruptcy filing. Utilities, which were a positive influence in the overall 1986 trend, should be a pocket of strength again this year. But like last year, gas utilities could buck this trend, S and P said. The rating agency said that downgrades would continue to outpace upgrades among financial institutions. But 1987's rating changes will not be as skewed as 1986's 2.1 to one ratio of downgrades to upgrades, S and P predicted. S and P said debt ratings for the transportation industry would remain stable, aside from changes because of mergers. A detailed report will appear in the March 9 S/P Creditweek. Reuter "
[u'usa', u'nicaragua', u'iran']|"CONTRA LEADER LINKS MYSTERY DLRS TO ARMS SALE

Nicaraguan rebel leader Adolfo Calero has for the first time linked payments received for his forces to a dummy company controlled by former White House aide Oliver North, legal sources said. The company, Lake Resources Inc, was established by North and his ally, retired Air Force major General Richard Secord, and had a Swiss bank account into which proceeds from secret arms sales to Iran were deposited. Calero yesterday made public bank statements showing his group has received 32 mln dlrs since mid-1984, but said he has no idea who donated the money. Calero, head of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, known by its Spanish initials as FDN, provided the same records to a grand jury investigating the Iran arms scandal that has shaken the Reagan administration. The bank statements he showed reporters ended with March, 1985, so they shed no light on whether Iran arms profits were diverted to contra rebels since shipments of U.S. arms to Iran did not begin until September 1985. But last night, Calero told Cable News Network that he had just discovered deposits made in late October, 1985 by Lake Resources into a contra account in the Cayman Islands. This came at a time when proceeds from the Iran arms sales were being funneled to the Swiss bank account. ""I just found out,"" he said. Legal sources confirmed that Calero had turned over the newly disclosed information, which was brought to his attention after one of his lawyers noticed the two desposits made by Lake Resources buried in the mass of bank records. They said that Calero has promised to review in more detail the bank statements and pass along any further information on possible deposits by the North-Secord groups. The Tower commission said in its report that up to 19.8 mln dlrs from the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran was unaccounted for and may have been diverted to the contras. Calero's FDN is the largest of the contra rebel groups that are fighting to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista government of Nicaragua. On the advice of his lawyer, Calero declined to go into details about what he told the grand jury. Reuter "

[u'crude', u'usa', u'opec', u'iea']|"CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL

U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall. ""OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers,"" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. ""That could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher,"" he added. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to 18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week. The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a barrel. ""Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its 15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come under question,"" McKinley said. Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year. IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes, or about 74 days consumption. Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking. Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price. ""This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),"" the general trading manager of an international oil company told Reuters in a telephone interview. For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to be 14.7 mln bpd this week. Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments. ""This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues, the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there,"" McKinley said. International oil traders said that other short-haul crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available Mideast crudes earlier this week. If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading managers at several companies told Reuters. But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues. Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity Management, said OPEC production was lower ""because of the Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas."" He added, ""The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,"" he added. There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said. Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of 18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light. Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price. ""There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government deals, which are below official prices and this is probably being resold,"" one international trader said. Reuter "

The attempt by International Paper Co IP> and Stone Container Co STO> to raise linerboard prices could stick, industry analysts said, citing strong demand and tight capacity.

""It remains to be seen whether the increases will be accepted, but I think the odds are better than 50-50 they will,"" Mark Rogers, paper analyst for Prudential Bache said. Mead Corp ME> and Union Camp Corp UCC> said they are also considering price increases. Rogers, who has been aggressively recommending Stone and International Paper for several months, said the increases could stick because plants are running full tilt and little new capacity is coming on stream. ""The operating rates in linerboard are running at about 97 to 98 pct of capacity, but demand continues to climb,"" Gene Cartledge, chairman and chief executive officer of Union Camp said ""The industry is essentially sold out."" Cartledge said domestic linerboard shipments in January hit about 1.6 mln tons, six pct higher than January 1986, while exports hit 170,000 tons, three to four pct higher. Nevertheless, rising inventories could nip the increase in the bud, Lawrence Ross, forest products analyst for Paine Webber, said. ""Containerboard inventories have been growing for the past three months,"" Ross said. ""Over that time inventories rose from 4.8 weeks worth of supplies to 5.9 weeks most recently."" Also, Ross said that the Jacksonville, Fla., paper mill, 49 pct owned by Stone, is planning to come on stream again soon, which may help alleviate some of the supply constraints. ""The plant's capacity, by itself, is about two pct of the industry total,"" Ross said. But, Rogers said the Jacksonville mill ""won't be enough"" to significantly ease tight capacity this year. The price increase is necessary, he said, to attract more investment. Rates of return in the industry have been too low in recent years to merit inventment in new capocity, Rogers said, adding that he sees prices climbing to the 400 dlrs-a-ton range this year. ""The consensus on the Street is changing,"" he said, ""from whether there will be increases to when is the next increase and how much."" Reuter "

Lucky Stores Inc said it and investor Asher Edelman agreed on a settlement that prohibits Edelman and his group from taking specified actions to obtain control of the company and that limits the Edelman group's ownership of Lucky's stock to less than five pct of any voting securities. The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pending litigation between the parties, Lucky Stores said. The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman's motion to intervene in pending shareholder actions against Lucky Stores and its directors, the company said. In addition, the standstill provisions also apply to Hancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders, the company said. Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for the company to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set for December 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their views concerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the voting power of substantial Lucky stockholders. Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock, last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company. Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuring program that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its own common shares and reincorporation in Delaware. The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co, a chain of 324 retail stores, was one of the key parts of the restructuring program. Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnership subsequently sued in an attempt to block the proposed reincorporation, which was a condition of the repurchase and restructuring plan. Under this latest arrangement, Lucky Stores said it agreed to reimburse the Edelman group for 2.8 mln dlrs of out-of-pocket expenses, which include litigation and other costs. ""This agreement serves the interests of Lucky stockholders by avoiding the significant cost of continued litigation and the accompanying demands on management time,"" Lucky Stores chairman John Lillie said in a statement.

American Telephone and Telegraph Co's proposal to deregulate its long distance phone service is unlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but it should help the company's profits, analysts said. ""Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for large volume users, but status quo for residential users,"" said PaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman. But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that has constrained the company's profits in the long distance business, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said. ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distance business, the profits of which have been limited by a regulated rate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cut last year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct. Earlier today the company proposed to the Federal Communications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amount of time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up to its competitors to oppose it filings. MCI Communications Corp MCIC> made a similar filing yesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competition in the telephone business. Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs in the long-distance unit, and increase its profit margins previously constrained by the rate of return. But many said they did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices in the industry, simply because of the competition the phone industry giant faces. ""You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,"" said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. ""But you wouldn't see a rise."" Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT to selectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. ""It will give ATT a lot more flexibility,"" he said. ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number of companies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCC hearings. It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, the long distance joint venture between GTE Corp GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc UT>. ""We think the Congress of the FCC should establish a reasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it,"" a U.S. Sprint spokesman said.

It may also take some time for the proposals to go through, and in the process they may be altered by the various constituencies affected by the move.

[u'canada', u'japan']|"CANADA'S MOVE TO SHORTEN DEBT TERMS AIDS MARKET

The government's move to pare its huge financing costs by shortening debt maturities has left more room for other borrowers and sparked a lively market for treasury bills, senior market analysts said. The Bank of Canada, Ottawa's fiscal agent in the marketplace, revealed this week that sharply reduced borrowing needs has allowed the shift toward shorter bond terms and heavier emphasis on the weekly treasury bill auction, issued in terms of up to one year. ""The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances and lower financing costs,"" the Bank of Canada said in its 1986 annual report released this week. The government has said its budget deficit financing requirements will fall to 24 billion dlrs in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1987, from 30 billion dlrs the prior year. Projected fiscal 1988 requirements are 21.3 billion dlrs. The bank said that of last year's 19 new government bond issues, nearly two-thirds were for maturities of less than 10 years. Greater use was also made of bond auctions to market new issues with terms in the two- to five-year range. Meanwhile, treasury bills outstanding at year end totalled nearly 70 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984. Although the amount of money saved from moving away from the long bonds was not disclosed, bond experts believe it was considerable because of the much lower interest premiums paid on short term debt. But market watchers were unsure what affect the move will have on Japanese investors--who have been snapping up Canadian bonds at a record clip--because of their traditional preference for long term financings. Bond traders said the Japanese, who purchased a record 9.5 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds last year, have adapted to the changes by buying longer term provincial issues and shifting to the medium term issues offered by Ottawa. ""Their (Japanese) buying over the course of the last six months has been very much concentrated in the medium term maturities,"" noted one Canadian bond trader who asked not to be identified. Yet there was some concern a shortage could eventually develop for bonds that mature in 10 or more years. Said David Gluskin, vice-president of Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc, ""When interest rates finally seem to have stopped going down, there is going to be a flood of people trying to lock in the long end and not everyone will be able to get in the door."" But bonds analysts said at the moment with interest rates trending down, investors appear to welcome the change, especially the greater treasury bill financing. ""The wholesale market in treasury bills is very active,"" said Michael Berry, vice-president of the securities firm, Walwyn Stodgell Cohran Murray Ltd. The change also improves receptivity in the market for other borrowers, including provincial governments, the big utilities and corporations. ""There doesn't seem to any lack of bonds in the longer end now, that also may be the result that any percieved shortage has probably been taken up by provincial funding activities,"" commented Berry.

[u'ship', u'gas', u'brazil']|"BRAZIL STRIKES CAUSE GOVERNMENT MAJOR PROBLEMS

Strikes by Brazil's 40,000 seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing major headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt crisis. A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25 years and union leaders say they have seriously affected Brazilian exports by making idle 160 ships. On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest payments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most petrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial heartland, and in three other states closed down to press for higher fuel prices. There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage. The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the 72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras. The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today entitled ""Dangerous Confrontation,"" said: ""From the economic point of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost, with grave consequences for the supply situation and for the country's external trade."" The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected offers of up to 100 pct. Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due to rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless of the tribunal's ruling. Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse over the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not only workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station owners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of Curitiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for exceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions. Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their profits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six U.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents). Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last night as motorists filled up their tanks while they still could. Political sources said the government of President Jose Sarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel supply situation. Reuter "

Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure from one of its largest creditors, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in Encor Energy Corp Ltd>, energy industry analysts said. Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947 mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to pay down debt, analysts said. ""The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the direction that might make it a saleable asset,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named. Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd DM> is up for sale ""at the right price."" Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10 billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The Encor shares do not pay dividends. A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake. At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs. Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said. ""Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in recent weeks with a runup in crude prices,"" Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented. ""The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than they have been able to in recent years,"" he added. Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six dlrs in early February. The company also recently set up its own operating management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum, Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented. Dome and Encor ""are actually going to get farther apart. So (the sale) does make a lot of sense,"" Mote said. However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to Commerce Bank. ""I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as they can,"" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber. Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets. ""Other creditors generally all want to make sure that something they might be able to get a piece of is not being sold out from under them,"" said analyst Gobert. Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration. Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines. Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's debt and has a ""right of consent"" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's holding. Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares would seek some type of relief on the company's debt obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said. Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares, but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share ""are very attractive.""

Advocates of a 0/92 plan for feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional sources said. The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English (D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat. An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers. Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat, it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally, they said. If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week, sources said. English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear. Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an even greater cutback in the bill, they said. Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments. Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.) have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to include a 0/92 program for feedgrains. An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm bill, but to be fair to all crops. Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are greater than to idle the land, economists said. Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the impacts of such a program.

[u'usa', u'brazil', u'volcker']|"BRAZIL CRISIS SPURS RETHINK OF DEBT STRATEGY

Brazil's economic crisis is forcing a wholesale re-examination of the established strategy for dealing with developing-country debt, leading bankers say. While finance minister Dilson Funaro is unlikely to succeed in his attempt at seeking an outright political solution to the debt problem, Brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt has convinced at least some bankers that new ideas are needed. ""The time has come to look at the alternatives,"" one seasoned debt rescheduler said. Even before Brazil's move, the difficulty in syndicating the 77 billion dlr financing package for Mexico agreed to in principle last October was prompting top bankers to examine the way they are managing the debt crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, too, spoke recently of ""debt fatigue"" and the need to breathe new life into debt rescheduling procedures. There are already signs of change. Japanese banks are setting up a jointly owned firm to which they will transfer some LDC loans in a bid to strengthen their balance sheets, improve financial management and get tax breaks. But bankers said a move toward a greater governmental role will be gradual. ""The process is such that you cannot expect tangible progress in a short period of time,"" one banker said. Certainly, Funaro got a frosty reception in Washington and several European capitals in the past week when he called on government officials to explain Brazil's crusade for a political dialogue on debt. Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford, for instance, criticized what he called large-scale solutions such as debt forgiveness or the creation of new multilateral lending agencies. ""While such approaches may have some political appeal, they are impractical and ultimately counterproductive,"" Mulford told a House subcommittee this week. He could have added that any proposal that might be construed as a bail-out of U.S. banks would be a non-starter in Congress. But bankers said the Reagan Administration could promote accounting and regulatory changes to foster debt-equity swaps and debt securitization and to enable banks to consider interest capitalization as an alternative to new loans. Experts say the government must also make it easier for banks gradually to write down their third-world loan books. Mulford, in his Congressional testsimony, urged the banks to explore different options. ""The banks should be encouraged to look at the so-called menu approach,"" he said. Bankers said the aim would be to keep the loan syndicates intact or, conversely, to allow small banks to write off their exposure in a way that is not detrimental to major lenders. Big banks say it is unfair that small creditors continue to receive interest on old debt even if they do not contribute to new loans. In effect, large banks say they are making new loans that fund the interest payments on the old debt. To solve this problem - and to streamline the cumbersome negotiating process - Argentina has revived the idea of ""exit bonds"", which would be issued at a discount to small creditors in exchange for their existing debt, bankers said. The banks would be rid of the loans but would have to recognize a loss. Amid the swirl of new ideas, even the role of the commercial bank advisory committees has come under scrutiny. The principle of consensus on which the panels operate was challenged recently when Citibank - ironically, the original architect of the committee system - stubbornly refused for a time to endorse financing offers to the Philippines and Chile. The strains have not gone unnoticed in Washington. ""There does seem to be a lot of speculation about the frailty of the bank advisory committees,"" a U.S. official said. Brazil's Funaro heavily criticized the panels in London on Monday, charging that they are unresponsive to new ideas and that U.S. banks are over-represented on them. Hannes Androsch, chairman of Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein, said there was some truth to the charge. ""Sentiment is growing in Europe that we're no longer prepared to bail out the U.S. banks,"" he told reporters in New York this week. While U.S. bankers obviously see things differently, some have started to wonder whether the advisory committee is still the right tool for the job. ""The debt crisis has probably evolved beyond the capacity of commercial banks alone, at least in some cases,"" one top New York rescheduler said. But, with governments unable or unwilling to play a larger role, bankers see no alternative to the advisory committee. ""It's the worst form of government there is apart from all the others,"" one banker said, paraphrasing former British prime minister Winston Churchill's opinion about democracy. Reuter "

[u'interest', u'crude', u'usa', u'opec']|"POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES

Higher oil prices and stronger than expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S. interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive chart outlook, financial analysts said. The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment during February was above market expectations for a rise of 170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond futures that drove the June contract through key technical support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted. ""I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101,"" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday led to bullish forecasts by chartists. But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday. Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32 may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep losses. ""I tend to go along with the double top scenario,"" said Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico. Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals. Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week. The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectation that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on an improving inflation outlook. With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, ""the inflation outlook is improving,"" Leiner said, and that should lead to relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar prices. Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices remains a concern for the inflation outlook. Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday. ""The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,"" said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer. The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely ""media induced,"" Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC production may be within quotas, ""oil stocks are at tremendously high levels."" Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices. Reuter "

Senior officials in the West German coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's international monetary conference in Paris. Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion mark reduction would represent net tax relief. An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned. The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks. Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal increase in income tax. An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers 1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and medium-sized companies. The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would be introduced next year, ahead of schedule. The West German government had come under pressure from the United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of growth was uncertain. The government said in January it was aiming for real growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some economists have revised their predictions down to two or below. Stoltenberg said: ""We remain on a course of expansion. Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe, or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few days ago, remains open at the moment.""

As a British government investigation got under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship. Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover. Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed. Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned to pull them out of service at present. ""Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait and see. But it is too early to say what happened,"" he told BBC radio. As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts had already been expressed about the design of so-called ""RoRo"" ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise. In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads. Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety standards. But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design. Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge. ""As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability,"" he said. Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level. ""If you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of the ship,"" he added. REUTER "

The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

Any European Community decision to liberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapioca industry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI). He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move to cut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops more competitive than tapioca in the European market. The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing more than two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported by Thailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25 mln tonnes a year until 1990. Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariff loophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pct import duty. Ammar, head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI, suggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops. He said: ""If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they are close to world prices, the tapioca market there will disappear completely."" He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because it had recently joined other major commodity producers in calling on the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies. REUTER "

[u'interest', u'west-germany']|"GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS

Increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds higher this year, bond market sources say. ""At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners,"" one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in Frankfurt said. The sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs. Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue. This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct. But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors, and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon. Sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last May. One finance ministry economist said ""It isn't more. It's just the size (of each bond) which has increased."" He added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt. Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad, with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors. With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however, foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish. Sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks. The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26.6 billion. The sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form. Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce income next year. ""The problem here will be the tax reform,"" the portfolio manager said. He added that the government's cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings. The sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other. The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the issue of fixed-rate medium-term ""Kassenobligation"" notes. A finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net 22.3 billion marks this year. Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect. ""I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase,"" the manager said. Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier. But sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark. ""The demand wasn't so good,"" a dealer for a German bank in London said. The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently, some dealers said. REUTER "

The outlook for Australian industrial investment is uncertain, with capital spending at an historical low and business overly dependent on domestic demand, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research said. The organizations were commenting in their monthly Economic Focus on a survey commissioned by the Australian Council of Trade Unions concluded. Private investment as a proportion of gross domestic product fell to 9.8 pct in 1985/86 from 15 pct in 1981 and is forecast to decline to 8.8 pct in 1987/88, the Focus said. Earlier studies indicated private investment could sustain a two pct long-term economic growth rate, but the latest figures suggested this could not be maintained, it said. The Australian dollar's depreciation, coupled with research incentives, is increasing the profitability of investment for exports but several factors inhibit growth. These include weak commodity prices, high fixed capital costs, uncertain domestic economic policy and corporate debt. Firms have tended to finance expansion with debt rather than equity, leading to a 39 pct rise in the ratio of interest payments to gross cash flow between 1980/85, the survey found. Economic Focus said many companies looked for a 2.5 to 4.5 year payback on capital investment or export development -- often too short a period to secure markets. The relatively low incentive to produce for export in part reflected the ownership of Australian industry, they said.

Three Japanese credit rating agencies are entering into fierce competition with Moody's Japan K.K.> and Standard and Poor's Asia Inc>, the local branches of the two U.S. Giants, as the Japanese credit market opens up to foreigners, Japanese rating agency managers said. Standard and Poor's recent triple-A rating of Chiyoda Fire and Marine Insurance Co Ltd's> claims-paying ability caused the Japanese agencies, which had rated Chiyoda's convertible bond only A-plus, to come under some criticism for being too conservative, they said. Chiyoda is Japan's eighth largest non-life insurer. Standard and Poor's Corp has been in the business for more than a century while Moody's Investors Service Inc> was founded more than 80 years ago. Each has rated some 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. And about 100 Japanese issues. With Japanese insurers eager to issue more bonds through overseas financing companies, Chiyoda's rating will stimulate their interest in using the U.S. Agencies, the analysts said. Standard and Poor's said Chiyoda's rating was based on its strong capitalisation, stable performance and high levels of unrealised appreciation, particularly in its stock portfolio. The U.S. Agency also emphasised the favourable regulatory environment in which Japan's non-life insurers operate. Japanese agencies were shocked by the earlier AAA ratings on the claims-paying ability of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co> and Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co> by Standard and Poor's, the first ratings given to Japanese life insurers. Strong Japanese insurers can accumulate cash to ward off shocks from any foreign investment, Standard and Poor's said. A month ago Nippon Investors Service Inc> (NIS) assigned an AAA rating to Financial Securities Assurance Inc>, a U.S. Firm that gives financial guarantees on corporate securities. ""NIS has assigned rates on a U.S. Firm for the first time in Japan, which was the first step into the U.S. Rating market,"" Kazuya Kumura, general manager of NIS, said. Kyosuke Yoshida, managing director of Japan Bond Research Institute (JBRI), said, ""Agencies should be more actively used to respond better to growing overseas investor interest."" Takeshi Watanabe, president of Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd (JCRA), said, ""(Our) advantages are that we have a deeper understanding of business practices in Japan, other Asian nations and Japanese investor behaviour and are also more alert and quick to react to domestic news."" JBRI, with 12 years' experience, is Japan's largest agency. The other two have been in business for two years. Finance Ministry approval of yen commercial paper issues by Japanese residents, which is expected soon, will stimulate local agencies to grow quickly, securities analysts said. The Finance Ministry is encouraging more use of agencies by gradually abolishing limits on corporate debt creation. In December it allowed non-residents holding at least an A-rating from one of the agencies to issue samurai, shogun and euroyen bonds without first meeting the normal stringent financial criteria. But local companies, regardless of the rating obtained for a planned bond, must meet the tough financial criteria set by commissioned banks and underwriters, which includes minimum net asset requirements and capitalisation, local agency managers said. Commissioned banks are responsible for protecting bondholders and conducting principal and coupon payments. Investors' risk in corporate default has been checked by the very system that is slowing the smooth growth of Japanese credit rating agencies, the managers said. ""The idea of rating in Japan has been woven into prerequisites for an issuer company to satisfy financial criteria,"" JCRA's Watanabe said. The Finance Ministry, commissioned banks and securities houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight bonds.

The proposal is a response to overseas calls for Japan to liberalise its markets in the trend towards global trading. Japanese brokerages are consistently heavy buyers of U.S. Treasury issues.

The Finance Ministry later approved the arrangement. Foreign brokers want to underwrite more government bonds due to their end-investor appeal. Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd> caught market attention by buying 45 billion yen of the 100 billion of government two-year notes auctioned on February 3. Salomon's operation was an attempt to demonstrate its commitment to the Japanese market in the hope of expanding its underwriting share of 10-year bonds, securities sources said.

The United States has openly attacked Japan's tight-fisted fiscal policy for the first time and warned Tokyo its promised economic package in April must be significant, senior U.S. Officials said. In high-level talks last week, the U.S. Criticised Japan's overall fiscal policy as deflationary and argued that its fiscal position is not as dire as it says. The criticism reflects a growing feeling among some U.S. Policy-makers that Japan's tight fiscal policy is frustrating attempts to stimulate domestic demand and boost imports. The U.S. Attack represents a distinct shift by the conservative Reagan administration, which until recently has been sympathetic to Tokyo's efforts to reduce the government role in the economy, diplomats said. Pointing out that Japan pledged in Paris last month to take action to boost demand, a senior U.S. Treasury official said the April package must be more than routine. Japanese government bureaucrats have already said they do not expect the package to contain much more than a rehash of last April's measures. That means accelerated public investment, lower interest rates on government housing loans and measures to pass along the benefits of the strong yen to consumers, none of which would have a major immediate economic impact. Several Japanese officials agreed that the real obstacle to stimulating the economy is the fiscal policy pursued by the Finance Ministry and said they welcomed the shift in U.S. Policy. But they expressed concern that the move might backfire by fanning resentment against U.S. Interference in domestic affairs. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said Japan would stimulate the economy not in response to U.S. Criticism, but to meet mounting pressure from Japanese businessmen. The shift in U.S. Policy is also causing some nervousness within the Reagan administration. U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told reporters last week the U.S. Does not necessarily want an increase in Japan's budget deficit. ""There are many measures Japan could take to stimulate its economy,"" he said. The argument is not new and has been raised in the past by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. What is new is U.S. Backing for the position. At last week's talks, Japanese officials said, they argued Tokyo had been able to maintain a tight fiscal stance and boost the economy with funds from the giant postal savings system. But the Finance Ministry was interested enough to ask for, and receive, the figures supporting the new U.S. Position, a senior U.S. Official said. Other western officials are not so sure. They said it would take time to boost public investment much further, as there are not that many projects in the pipeline. Stepped-up capital spending would help domestic construction companies, but it would not have much impact on imports, they added. REUTER "

An existing New York Stock Exchange, NYSE, rule might be used to limit the trading activities of its members in London in stocks listed on both exchanges, sources at the London Exchange said. This could arise if the London Stock Exchange goes ahead with plans to close its trading floor. The London Exchange sources were commenting on press reports that the NYSE would bar its members firms from trading on the London Exchange in interlisted stocks during periods when the NYSE was open. The London exchange is seeking clarification. London Exchange sources said the possibility of restrictions on NYSE members appears to reflect a rule which requires that exchanges recognised by the NYSE possess a trading floor. Last month, the London Exchange said in a statement that it planned to close its floor in due course, apart from a floor for traded options, because almost all business is now being done by screen and telephone between brokerage offices. This development stemmed from the Big Bang restructuring of the market on October 27. The demise of the traditional Stock Exchange floor has been widely expected, though no date has been set as yet. Market sources said a compromise over the NYSE rule could well be reached, partly because the interests of U.S. Securities dealers are not all identical. Some of them could well start lobbying the NYSE, pointing out, among other things, that the expansion of global trading needs to be based on reciprocal arrangements. NYSE brokerage firms which also trade on the London Exchange would presumably be put at a disadvantage over non-NYSE U.S. Firms, which have affiliates on the London Exchange, market sources said.

The offer and withdrawal rights are to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to be followed by a merger at the same price. USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option to buy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances. Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding. USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmont on a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to buy and hold shares pending review of its application to gain control of Piedmont. The company said its merger agreement with Piedmont provides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont's prior written consent in any way that would be adverse to Piedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number of shares to be bought without Piedmont's consent.

The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said. The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December. It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year. The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan. It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices. It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986. It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year. The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged. It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said. ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said. ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter U.S. Fsical policy,"" it said. It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss. ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar would collapse. To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis, it said. On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look ""increasingly sick."" Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said. The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December, the EIU said. On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar. It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986. Reuter "

Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut leading interest rates again if the United States makes a similar move, banking sources said. The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposium in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press representatives were not invited. The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200 bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates would give room for a matching measure in Germany. ""It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates,"" said one banker who attended the symposium. A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no comment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting. But, according to a second source, who also declined to be identified, Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as a direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark. ""He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,"" the second source said. In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cut in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such a move in advance, the sources said. Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, by cuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early as last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying, ""No, they wouldn't have been. We checked that."" The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates. Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, saying that financial markets had not fully realised the significance of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further falls in the value of the dollar, the sources said. For the first time all participants at the summit agreed that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all world economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said. The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boosted growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around current levels by international central bank cooperation. One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the fact that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in West Germany's economic growth. Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past stressed that the German central bank had no direct responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with combatting inflation. This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter monetary stance from the beginning of December until the half-point cut in rates in late January. The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react immediately whenever such overshooting occurs. Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at 7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target. Share prices rose in very active trading today, with dealers reporting that Poehl's remarks, coupled with a bullish outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium, brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels.

The 20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling accord Venezuela signed a week ago will reduce its payments over the next three years by 64 pct, according to Finance Ministry figures released this weekend. A ministry statistical analysis said while the original accord called for payments of 3.82 billion dlrs between 1987 and 1989, the new agreement requires debt servicing of 1.35 billion over the same period. In 1987, Venezuela will be required to pay 250 mln dlrs instead of the 1.55 billion originally agreed. Payments in 1988 were cut to 400 mln from 1.20 billion, and in 1989 to 700 mln from 1.11 billion. The ministry's analysis said the reduction in debt servicing during 1987-1989 amounts to an effective grace period, something the Venezuelan negotiators sought from creditor banks but were not granted. Most of the rescheduling falls during 1994-1998, when 53.3 pct, or some 11.25 billion dlrs, must be paid. Under the February 27 accord, Venezuela will repay 20.3 billion dlrs of public sector debt over 14 years at 7/8 of a percentage point over London interbank offered rates (Libor). This compares with the February 1986 accord which called for a 12-year term and interest of 1-1/8 point over Libor. REUTER "

MTS Acquisition Corp>, a company formed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer for all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each. In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended. Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and is Caesars' largest shareholder. Caesars owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc CJN>, which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel. For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a year before. For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0 mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs. MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy all Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board. MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc MM> has committed to lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing for the transaction. It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc PWJ>, has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475 mln dlrs in ""mezzanine"" financing. MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition, since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared. In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World board, a request that has not yet been granted. In September 1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp>, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct. Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that ""The decision to go directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the lack of responsiveness of the management in the past."" Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder values, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board seat. ""My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice, you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer rather than giving it serious consideration,"" he said. Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him. ""As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe operating management of the company has performed well and that appropriate consideration should be given to a significant equity interest for them in the company following the acquisition,"" Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck. MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election or removal of directors.

Dutch economic growth is slowing as a firming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries reduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planning agency CPB said. The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economic outlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected to grow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in 1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984. Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20 billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increase from last year's 423.95 billion. The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value of the guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pct last year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an average of 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986. ""The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit labour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, while these are rising slightly in the Netherlands,"" the CPB said. More of economic growth now depended on domestic consumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins set by domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on purchasing power of lower import costs and deflation. Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, the CPB said. Inflation was zero last year. Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five pct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last year, the CPB said. Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to condition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent years, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of these factors on Dutch competitiveness. In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social security costs to employers. The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2 pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year, urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down the deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in future. Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by falling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said. It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this year from 710,000 last year. While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is within its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two pct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates. Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in its February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant prices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts had expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its own latest estimate. ""It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the whole document yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some of our estimates,"" a Pierson economist said. The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in 1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy exports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said. Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with four pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said. The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the surplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1 billion last year, the CPB forecast. REUTER "

[u'usa']|"TECHNOLOGY/NEW ERA FOR INFORMATION HANDLING

Ground-breaking new systems for storing and retrieving information are ushering in a new era for computer companies and computer users. Within the past few weeks, International Business Machines Corp IBM>, Eastman Kodak Co EK> and others have launched products that radically increase the amount of data that can be catalogued and shelved in computerized libraries. ""This flurry of new technology could yield systems that handle a multimedia blitz of data,"" said Ian Warhaftig, a senior analyst with International Data Corp, Framingham, Mass. ""We're developing new systems because our customers are asking for them,"" Peter Giles, vice president and general manager of Kodak's mass memory division, said in a recent interview. This demand is expected to soar in coming years. While estimates vary, industry analysts project that providing products and services geared for information storage and retrieval could become a 20 billion dlr a year business by 1995. A wide range of technologies will be needed to meet the varying requirements of users. For example, a large credit verification service would want a system from which it could quickly retrieve credit data and relay it to its clients. A law firm, however, may need a computerized law library in which capacity, rather than speed, is the key feature. For architects and engineers, the ability to store photographs, sketches and other graphics would be crucial. Regardless of the specific application, the trend is toward converting information - documents, video or film or even sound recordings - into to the digital language of zeros and ones understood by computers. Saving space is the key goal in digitizing data for storage. An optical disk the size of a standard compact disk can store 550 megabytes of data, or about 250,000 pages of typewritten text. For this reason, the compact disk read-only memory, or CD-ROM, is already a popular data storage media. Last week, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Bookshelf, a 300 dlr program that contains, on a single CD-ROM disk, a dictionary, thesaurus, national ZIP code directory, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, the World Almanac and other reference works. Scores of such products are already on the market, but most are specialty items, such as Lotus Development Corp's LOTS> CD-ROM data base of stock information for financial analysts and investors. ""Microsoft Bookshelf is important because it marks the arrival of CD-ROM packages for the general public,"" said Ian Warhaftig of International Data Corp. One drawback of the CD-ROM, which uses a laser to record and read data, is that that it requires a special player. CD-ROM players for the retail market will appear later this year. Moreover, IDC's Warhaftig said CD-ROM's will be integrated with personal computers. ""Eventually, CD-ROM's will fit right inside the PC box,"" he said. ""Imagine the advantage of having a spelling checker and thesaurus at your fingertips when you're writing with a word processing program."" But CD-ROM's are just the beginning. Also last week, Kodak unveiled several systems that use 12-inch optical disks. The largest Kodak system uses a jukebox-like cabinet to hold up to 150 optical disks from which data can be retrieved in a matter of seconds. Kodak also announced a 14-inch optical disk with 6.8 gigabytes of memory, five times the memory of a CD-ROM. The Kodak disk, which will not be available until the middle of 1988, is designed for users who need quick access to very large amounts of data, said Kodak's Giles. Meanwhile, N.V. Philips PGLO.AS>, the Dutch electronics giant, is preparing to take optical disk technology a step further with the first disk that can combine text, video and sound. Philips said the system, called Called CD-Interactive, will be ready next year. It will include a new kind of CD-ROM player that can hook up with a television set and stereo. Additional breakthroughs are expected as the next generation of computer memory chips are introduced. Last month IBM said it has made a four-megabyte chip, capable of storing more data than eight CD-ROM's. Meantime, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone> of Japan said it has built a 16-megabyte chip. Analysts say commercial versions of these chips are several years away, though some suspect that IBM may start volume production of its four-megabyte chip sometime this year. Such chips will enable computer makers to build computers with immense memory capacities. Reuter "

[u'usa']|"PAPER INSTITUTE SEES STRONG PAPER MARKET IN '87

The American Paper Institute said the industry is headed for another year of record volume in 1987, with linerboard particularly strong. ""A pro-growth trade policy, continued attention to currency management, a fairly low interest rate climate and no major tax increases are the essential ingredients in this outlook,"" Red Cavaney, American Paper Institute president said. Cavaney said that so far this year the industry's performance mimics last year's strength. Last year, he said, paper and paperboard production hit a record 71 mln tons, 5.9 pct above 1985's 67 mln tons, while industry after-tax profits in 1986 exceeded 1985 profits. Cavaney said that inventories will play a major role in this year's performance. ""Inventories, which are generally low, are a positive factor in the industry's outlook this year,"" he said, citing market pulp stocks, which are currently at 21 days supply, at the low end of the industry's long term average. Cavaney added that as a result of slimmer inventories in 1986 and in the early part of this year, shipments for 1987 as a whole will be higher than last year, even if demand slackens. Cavaney said, however, he expects demand this year to be strong, spurred by consumer spending. The benefits of tax reform on individual after-tax income and consumer goods companies' cash flow, he said, will increase demand for both communications paper and packaging this year. In addition, Cavaney said low mortgage rates should support high levels of housing starts in 1987, increasing demand for many kinds of packaged goods. Inventory building should help demand for cartons and corrugated containers this year, he added. Cavaney said he expects exports to remain fairly high in 1987, as well, as a result of the recent declines in the dollar against major world currencies. But more importantly, he said, an improved balance of trade in 1987 from the lower dollar would induce increased industrial activity at home and thus higher packaging demand. Cavaney said increased competitiveness, caused by lower costs, higher productivity and improved efficiency would also contribute to a strong showing from the industry this year. Cavaney said, however, that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 could have a negative impact on the industry this year. ""For manufacturers, the removal of the investment tax credit creates an impediment to future investment,"" he said. Also, he said API estimates the industry will lose three billion dlrs in cash flow over a five year period as a result of reforms. ""Adjustments to this loss will require time and careful evaluation and will adversely affect the capital spending decisions of individual companies,"" Cavaney said. Reuter "

West Germany takes ""very seriously"" the recent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote exchange rate stability around current levels, Finance Ministry State Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said. Talking to journalists before a meeting of European Community Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements for stabilising currencies. But he noted the official communique said the participants agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. ""We're taking this sentence very seriously,"" he said. Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against the mark since the meeting. He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris agreement should help in this respect. Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and had not ruled out ""appropriate and timely"" action if necessary. Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the economic situation in the 12-nation bloc.

Uganda, Africa's second largest coffee producer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffee talks in London, the chairman of the state-run Coffee Marketing Board, CMB, said. ""This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in a situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of robusta coffee,"" J. Makumbi said when he returned from London on Friday. Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula to share the world's coffee production during International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week. Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were suspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that its quota be increased dramatically. Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings -- had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln 60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB. The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25 pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to over three mln bags. For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICO export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry. The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs over half of salaried manpower.

The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

[u'earn', u'usa']|"SOUTHERN SO> TO TAKE CHARGE ON VOGTLE COST

Southern Co said it will take an after-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later than January 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclear power plant has risen abover the amount which retail customers in Georgia will be asked to pay. The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, said the budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mln dlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the made last year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increased cost will not be included in the utility's retail electric rates. Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduled completion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September 1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added. The utility said fuel loading has been completed at Unit One and the unit is being put through a series of low-power tests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for a full-power license. The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., is co-owned by Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton. Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate was due to several factors, including additional labor costs incurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule for commercial operation by June. The new figure represents the first change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when it was estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs. In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would ""cap"" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to pay at 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected 8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Power said, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs. Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is 313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a charge against earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes. In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contracts with the joint owners require the utility to buy back significant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant's initial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, it will not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increase that applies to the buybacks. This bings the total amount that must be charged against earnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said. Southern said new rules of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which are effective in January 1988, require any costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be charged against earnings once that determination is made. The company also said its board has approved a capital budget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on the Vogtle project. It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the three-year period 1987-1989 was also outlined at the board meeting, noting this is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years 1986-1988.

The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said. The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December. It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year. The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan. It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices. It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986. It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year. The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged. It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said. ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said. ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter U.S. Fiscal policy,"" it said. It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss. ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would collapse. To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis, it said. On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look ""increasingly sick."" Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said. The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December, the EIU said. On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar. It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986. However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984, the EIU said. After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said. It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6 pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986. Reuter "

A free trade pact between the United States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially, according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics. The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S. export's by about seven pct. He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150 billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They are aiming for a pact by next October. Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of Maryland, said an agreement should include: - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased in over a five to 10-year period; - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries, replacing current ""Buy America"" and ""Buy Canada"" provisions with a ""Buy North America"" provision; - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance and transportation; - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers; - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes. Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to 2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties. The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct. He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage.

Discussions are taking place with the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange, BIFFEX, and the GAFTA London Grain Futures Market is considering the possibility of joining the other markets, market officials said. The BIFFEX board is expected to reach a decision on the merger at its meeting at the end of this month, after members are consulted at a meeting on March 16. The grain futures market also intends to consult its members soon, GAFTA director general James Mackie said. The aim of the amalgamation is to limit regulatory and administrative costs and achieve the recognition required under the 1986 Financial Services Act. This legislation requires a futures market to become a Recognised Investment Exchange, RIE, for trading to continue. Representatives of all the futures markets on the Baltic Exchange have been discussing the possibility of a single RIE structure since the beginning of the year. The new exchange now planned will apply to the Securities and Investments Board for recognition as an RIE ""at the appropriate time,"" the Agricultural Futures Exchange said. ""This commitment by the markets will enable progress to be made to develop a stronger and more effective exchange to the benefit of all those involved in the industry,"" the chairman of the formation committee, Pat Elmer, said.

Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling's strength. The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March 17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures. However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half-point cut. Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling. Most market participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget, although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage. Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond market. To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains. Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week's. However, they noted that although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final 71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300 GMT.

President Reagan's denial that he knew proceeds from Iran arms sales were diverted to Nicaraguan contra rebels might be challenged by his former national security adviser, according to the Washington Post. The paper said yesterday that John Poindexter, who resigned last November when the illegal transfer of up to 20 mln dlrs was disclosed, was ready to break the silence he has so far maintained over the affair. The Post said he might tell a special Senate committee investigating the Iran scandal that he told Reagan twice in 1986 that money from Iran sales was being used for aid to the contras. It said the panel was considering granting Poindexter immunity from prosecution over the fund diversion, which was illegal under a Congressional ban in force at the time against aid for the contras. Poindexter has so far invoked the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution which protects people from giving evidence which could be self-incriminating. Reagan has said he authorized the sale of arms to Iran in the hope of establishing links with Iranian moderates, but has denied knowing that proceeds were ending up in Nicaraguan rebel hands. A White House spokesman had no comment on the Post story, but David Abshire, who is coordinating White House handling of the affair, said Reagan would never approve any illegal action. Abshire, on the CBS television show ""Face the Nation,"" did not comment directly on the Post story, but said: ""He (Reagan) is deeply honest, he is deeply dedicated, he tells the truth and when he says he has no knowledge, he has no knowledge."" The Post quoted a source close to Reagan as saying the White House expected Poindexter ""will say he had direction and authority, directly or indirectly,"" from the president for the diversion of funds. The paper said the former security adviser's testimony could damage the president's claim he was unaware of the funds diversion. It quoted a legal source as saying Poindexter and his lawyers planned to contend that twice in 1986 he told Reagan that the arms sales were generating money for the ""contras."" The paper quoted the source as saying Poindexter did not tell Reagan there was an illegal diversion of funds, but that help for the contras was ""an ancillary benefit"" of the sales.

Petro-Canada, Canada's state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland. Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said. Depending on time required for regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as early as 1991, Petro-Canada said. ""We have a high degree of confidence that the western portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels, and that we could produce it economicly using a floating production system,"" Petro-Canada said. The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St. John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984. ""We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up additional reserves there,"" the company said. Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources towards development so it can start generating a return on investments, Petro-Canada said. Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells, has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd, Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX. Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil, company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary office. Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels, he added. Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the development budget could double if the company builds a production system combining both blocks in the field, he said. Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily production, with a production system that would have maximum capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in answer to a query.

[u'money-fx', u'interest', u'uk']|"UK MONEY RATES FALL AS BANK APPROVES BASE RATE CUT

A half point cut in base lending rates was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of downward pressure, dealers said. During its routine intervention in the market, the bank trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing banks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct. The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17. For some time, fundamentals have led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow wholesale money market rates down. Although political considerations -- the government's wish to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- had been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank's delaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling and perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of the Budget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealers said. In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut, leaving the market still looking for another half point fall. Consequently, rates in the money market eased during the day, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to 10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at 10-5/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cd's were similarly down between 5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year.

[u'usa']|"U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - S/P CUT HAS NO EFFECT

In an unusual move, Standard and Poor's Corp downgraded a U.S. corporate debt issue soon after it was priced for offering late last week. But, unlike a similar action in September 1986, which investment bankers said disrupted the financing, the agency's rate reduction had no effect this time, traders said. S and P announced Friday afternoon that it cut to B from B-plus a 900 mln dlr issue of senior notes due 1994 of Holiday Inns Inc, a unit of Holiday Corp HIA>. The notes were priced late Thursday by sole manager Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. In a release, Standard and Poor's said the action reflected a change in the note issue's terms to an unsecured form of debt from secured. That change was made after the agency rated the notes on February 20, S and P stated. ""We took action as we became aware that the issue's structure had changed,"" said Robert Nelson of S and P. ""We generally make a distinction between secured and unsecured debt, and this was the key factor in our downgrade."" A spokesman for Drexel said the action did not affect the Holiday Inns deal, which had already sold out to investors by late Friday afternoon. ""The Holiday notes are trading at 100.50 on a when-issued basis,"" the Drexel spokesman said soon after S and P's announcement. The 10-1/2 pct notes had been priced at par. That is a far cry from late September, when S and P downgraded a 215 mln dlr issue of subordinated sinking fund debentures due 1998 of New World Pictures Ltd NWP> just hours after the pricing. Because of the rating cut to CCC-plus from B-minus, the underwriter halted sales and repriced the issue. Sole manager L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin initially gave the debentures a 12-1/4 pct coupon and par pricing. It then repriced the issue at 97 to yield 12.74 pct. New World Pictures had increased the issue to 215 mln dlrs from an original offering of 150 mln dlrs, and that brought in S and P. The agency cited the larger financing in its action and said it believed the issuer's cash from existing operations would not be enough to adequately service debt. An officer with S and P said at the time the rating agency was not told beforehand that the issue had been increased in size. Usually, issuers and underwriters alert the rating agencies to any changes in debt offerings, he said. In both cases, Moody's Investors Service Inc declined to follow suit, bond traders noted. Indeed, Moody's announced Friday that its original rating of B-1 for the Holiday Inns notes remained appropriate. Moody's pointed out that while the seven-year notes would be unsecured obligations of Holiday Inns, the issue would benefit from a negative pledge provision and a call for specified collateral under certain circumstances. The agency also said the B-1 rating continued to recognize a highly leveraged debt structure that would result from Holiday's recapitalization program, as well as the company's dependence on property sales to produce adequate cash flow for near-term debt service. ""Aside from Holiday Inns and New World Pictures, I cannot remember the last time an issue was downgraded so soon after the pricing,"" remarked one corporate bond trader. Holiday Inns also sold Thursday via Drexel 500 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures due 1999 with an 11 pct coupon and par pricing. The debentures' ratings of B-2 by Moody's and B-minus by S and P were left unchanged on Friday. The combined offering of 1.4 billion dlrs was the second-largest junk bond deal ever brought to market, underwriters and traders said. They said the biggest was BCI Holdings' 2.35 billion dlr offering on April 10, 1986. That the Holiday Inns deal sold out quickly underscored the appetite of many investors for high-yield securities. ""People are hungry for yield. They are not worried about downside risk at all, especially for junk bonds issued by well-known companies,"" said one portfolio manager. As a result, investors are expected to snap up this week's planned offerings by Allied Stores Corp of 200 mln dlrs of senior notes due 1992, rated B-2/B, and 600 mln dlrs of senior subordinated debentures due 1997, rated B-3/CCC-plus.

The Department is scheduled to release the new estimate at 1500 hrs EST (2100 gmt) today. Analysts said the market is anticipating a downward revision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted. The estimate, which the USDA has left unchanged since October, should be affected this time by recent evidence of a shortfall in the early and midseason crop now that those harvests are complete. Analysts said based on earlier USDA projections, the harvests should have been five to seven mln boxes larger than they were. ""They are going to cut their estimate,"" said Bob Tate, an FCOJ broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in Miami. ""The only question is whether they will admit the whole thing in this estimate."" Tate said it is possible the USDA will lower its estimate by a lesser amount, perhaps three mln boxes, and continue to drop the estimate in subsequent reports as the crop picture clarifies.

The INRA renegotiation conference, which resumed today under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is scheduled to last until March 20. Xuto told delegates this session of the conference presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it had to be the last before the current accord expires in October.

""It is imperative that we try to settle the major outstanding issues in the course of this week, since a considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to be completed."" He said he will immediately start consultations with producers and consumers. The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreement over buffer stock operations. Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls, aimed at preventing INRA from following the collapse of the International Tin Agreement (ITA), were rejected by producers who argued for unchanged INRA terms. The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out of funds to support prices.

[u'west-germany']|"GERMAN BANKS SAY COMPANY HOLDINGS FALLING

West German private banks, in the latest twist in a long-running battle over the size of their holdings in industry, have said the holdings were falling and rejected calls for tighter limits on these participations. Under West Germany's banking system, banks can hold shares in non-banking companies giving them seats on company supervisory boards, and administer the holdings of small shareholders in safe custody accounts. Holdings of over 25 pct, which give a veto right in the supervisory board of a company, must be disclosed. ""The claim that the concentration of power has intensified, as made by the Monopolies Commission, therefore turns out not to be accurate ... There is no reason to impose further legal restrictions on the acquisition of holdings by banks,"" it said. The Association's letter is the latest skirmish in a long running battle between banks on the one hand and a range of government offices and political lobbies on the left and right. The number of holdings above 10 pct in public companies with a nominal share capital of over one mln marks held by these 10 banks fell to 86 in 1986 from 129 in 1976, it said. Of these 43 reductions, 41 represented holdings of over 25 pct in 1976. The banks' holdings of nominal share capital fell to 1.70 billion marks in 1986, or 1.34 billion adjusted for capital changes in the past 10 years from 1.80 billion in 1976. Over this period total West German nominal share capital rose to 235 billion marks from 136 billion, so that the holding of banks in German companies fell to 0.7 pct from 1.3 pct. The nominal share capital of listed non-bank companies rose to an estimated 49 billion marks in 1986 from 35.58 billion in 1976, with banks' holdings falling to 1.57 billion marks or 3.2 pct from 1.61 billion marks or 4.5 pct, the Association said. It argued that bank representatives were in a minority on the supervisory boards of the 100 biggest German companies, and in most cases could be blocked by non-banking representatives. The survey covered Deutsche Bank AG DBKG.F>, Dresdner Bank AG DRSD.F>, Commerzbank AG CBKG.F>, Bayerische Vereinsbank AG BVMG.F> and Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank AG BHWG.F>. It also covered Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank BHFG.F>, Berliner Bank AG>, Industriekreditbank AG>, Vereins- und Westbank AG VHBG.F> and Baden-Wuerttembergische Bank AG>. Deutsche holds by far the largest number of such stakes, including 28.5 pct of Daimler-Benz AG DAIG.F>. Criticism of the bank holdings has not only come from the Monopolies Commission and left-wing parties. An advisory commission, in a report late last year to the Economics Ministry, urged implementation of the five pct proposed by the Monopolies Commission to promote competition and avoid interest conflicts. The Economics Ministry has been controlled by the liberal Free Democrat Party, junior partner in the centre-right coalition government and increasingly in favour of deregulation. Furthermore the West German Supreme Court recently supported an action by a private Deutsche shareholder demanding more transparency in the bank's balance sheet. The shareholder argued that the bank's ability to declare industrial stakes of more than 25 pct as only temporary holdings evaded the statutory requirement to report them in full. If a bank declares stakes temporary it does not have to disclose them but can include them under securities holdings. The case is due to be heard again by the Frankfurt higher regional court.

The World Bank intends to bring borrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it expects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bank vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said. He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan, West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. ""The weight of opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higher probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower interest rates,"" he said. The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates. The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where and how much to borrow, Rotberg said. Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years' anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years. Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, it did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the sake of innovation, Rotberg said. Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only some eight billion had been swapped into another currency. Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident that this was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments. The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over the next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However, for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new instruments such as bonds with warrants. The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany since the first issue was launched in 1959, he said. "

The hull and machinery of the Herald of Free Enterprise were valued at 25 mln stg and were insured by Townsend Thoresen's parent company Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc PORL.L>. The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market with Lloyds and various other companies, Larner said. Passengers, crew and cargo were insured by the Standard Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association, one of several shipowners' mutual insurance funds worldwide. These were also underwritten by Lloyds and other companies. Larner said claims from passengers could be expected to total at least five mln stg, given the number of deaths and the normal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974 of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death. Shipping sources said, however, that these claims could soar if a court found there was negligence or design faults involved. Larner said estimates of compensation claims ""were pure guess work"" at this time. But if the ship could not be salvaged, the claims would total at least 30 mln stg. Shares of insurances on the London stock exchange fell across the board in a generally weak market. General Accident fell 21p to 936, Royal Insurance dropped 18p to 966 and Prudential fell 9p to 888. P and O shares stood at a late 616, 27p lower on the day. REUTER "
[u'west-germany']|"GERMAN EMPLOYERS MAKE SURPRISE OFFER TO ENGINEERS

Engineering industry employers in North Rhine-Westphalia state said they made an unprecedented offer on pay and working hours. The offer, which came amid warning strikes by some 33,000 workers, was the first time since World War Two that employers have proposed cutting working hours and is seen as averting a repeat of the nationwide strike of 1984 which brought the auto industry to a standstill for seven weeks, union sources said. The employers propose a half-hour cut in the 38.5 hour working week from July 1, 1988 and a pay rise of 2.7 pct from April 1 and a further 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988. The engineering union IG Metall, Europe's largest union, wants a five pct wage rise and a 35-hour week at full pay. It called today's warning strikes, mostly involving work stoppages of up to one hour, after more than 50 rounds of talks since December failed. The employers' offer was seen breaking the deadlock in negotiations, even though the union said the half-hour cut is not enough, union sources said. The offer applies to workers in North Rhine-Westphalia and it was unclear if further offers would be presented in talks between unions and employers of other West German states. REUTER "

The company later reached an accord under which it would buy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed its leveraged buyout of the company.

""My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to be bought out,"" said Ballan.

Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a post stock split basis.

""But that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily, due to Purity Supreme in New England,"" Comeau said.

Rickels, a home center business, has faced problems due to the state of that industry, and has reported lower returns as an operating unit, according to analysts.

USX Corp chairman David Roderick called for a lower value for the U.S. dollar against other currencies to help speed a correction in the U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 170 billion dlrs. In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club of Detroit, Roderick said, ""There should be total resolve that the dollar versus other major currencies, as well as the currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus with us, must continue to decline so that the correction in our trade deficit starts on the road to recovery."" Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the ""economic pain"" our trading partners experience as a result of a falling dollar. But, he added, ""As painful as the correction may be to our trading partners, it is less painful than leaving the problem uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable, lengthy and steep world recession."" Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader group of currencies of nearly all developing nations. At the end of 1986, he said, the value of foreign assets in the U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240 billion dlrs, compared to five years ago when the U.S. had a surplus in assets of 141 billion. A company spokesman said the data were provided by economic consultants to USX. The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although other factors were involved, Roderick said. But it is wrong, he said, ""to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental deterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product quality."" These areas need to be improved but they are not the root cause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said. He urged American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can compete in global markets. In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes in securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate raiders and speculators. Among his proposals, which he presented to the Senate Banking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirement that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock they acquire in a company. Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be required to have financing in place before a tender is made. Further, raiders should be required to make an all-cash tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company's stock, he said. And payment of greenmail, or a preferential price by a target company to buy back a raider's stake, should be prohibited under the revised laws. Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets or discourage ""fair price to all"" takeovers. Reuter "

Two new eurosterling bonds were launched today, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this month, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria. The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in banks' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said this had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments. ""Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month and we're set to see many more eurosterling deals,"" one dealer said. Today's new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year, 100 mln stg deal for Sweden at 9-1/2 pct and priced at 101-1/4 pct, lead by Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd.

""Optically, psychologically, these single figures are much more attractive for the borrower. Eurosterling looks like a cheap and attractive way to raise your money,"" he added. This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have tapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as the Kingdom of Sweden today, continental banks including Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations.

McDonnell Douglas Corp said recent talks with Airbus Industries about joint development and production of a new jetliner with the European aircraft manufacturing consortium have been very informal. ""If there have been talks, they were casual at best,"" said a source at the company. ""There is nothing going on that would lead to immediate or near-term collaboration"" on a new plane. Senior officials at the aerospace firm's St. Louis headquarters were unable to comment more specifically on weekend published reports from Europe that talks about a joint venture have resumed after they broke off last fall. McDonnell Douglas and Airbus last spring and summer had discussed jointly developing and building a long-range aircraft to compete with Boeing Co BA> 747 wide-body jetliner, or its successor. Talks ended when neither side wanted to forego plans to launch its own widebody jetliner projects - McDonnell Douglas with its MD-11 and Airbus with its A340. McDonnell Douglas has since launched the MD-11 jetliner, a successor to its DC-10, and has more than 100 orders and options. Airbus wants to launch its program this spring and is now seeking customers for the long-range A340 and a companion plane, the shorter-range A330. ""I don't want to say we're not interested, because we are in any collaboration that benefits McDonnell Douglas without it giving up anything,"" the source told Reuters. ""There just haven't been in-depth discussions."" He said any joint venture would not affect the MD-11 program already underway. McDonnell Douglas last month claimed Airbus tried to overturn pledges made by airlines to buy the MD-11 by offering cut-rate prices for the A340. The firm said Airbus, in an effort to line up enough customers to launch the program, is engaging in ""predatory practices"" with prices substantially below those needed to recover the cost of developing and building the plane. U.S. government and aerospace industry officials believe Airbus can offer low prices because the consortium gets government subsidies that cover many of its costs. The Reagan Administration decided last month to consult the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, GATT, to determine whether Airbus is unfairly subsidized. Under GATT rules an enterprise can be subsidized but only if it will make a profit. U.S. officials say Airbus countries have poured 15 billion dlrs into Airbus since the early 1970's and the consortium has yet to make a profit. Reuter "

The Agriculture Department will have to release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kind certificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDA decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain deficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said. Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for the 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50 cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they want to do the same for feedgrains. Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn deficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42 billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split. However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs, doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs.

The U.S. Agriculture Department increased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes. In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA said the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the U.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and coarse grain from other major suppliers. USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up one mln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below the preliminary 1985/86 figure. Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mln tonnes.

a confidential world bank report on the peruvian economy said the government's strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to quickly lead to inflation. The report, published today by an economic monthly, the peru report, said the success of president alan garcia's government in stimulating output last year to achieve eight pct gross domestic product growth ""represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long."" Government officials had no immediate comment on the report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment programme and greater emphasis on the preservation of peru's export potential. The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation programme was encountering increasing difficulties. ""an early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls, appears not improbable,"" it added. "

European Community finance ministers discussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too pessimistic. The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks ago cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3 per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn. It said economic prospects had been less promising over the past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the dollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which would restrain Community exports. But diplomats said several member states, led by West Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy, especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise currencies around current levels. ""Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rather too pessimistic,"" said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired the meeting. The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for West Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear it feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe. But two top German officials, State Secretaries Otto Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need at the moment for action to bolster the EC's biggest economy. The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France, while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commission's view that Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth. "

Calls for a major overhaul of the U.S. banking industry, which would probably feature wider investment banking powers for commercial banks, has met strong opposition from private interest groups, such as the Securities Industry Association.

The Imperial Government of China issued bonds in 1911 to help construct a section of the so-called Hukuang railroad in an agreement with British, German, French and American banks.

Nine U.S. bondholders sued China for repayment of the loan in 1979, less than a year after the normalization of relations between Washington and Peking.

""One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items has been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,"" the spokesman said. Another CBT official, executive vice president George Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor.

""We've looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such things as flip-flopping the trading rooms,"" he added. It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets, Sladoje said. ""If we move out of one floor entirely, then the construction period will be about a year,"" he said, adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year.

In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits, exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains-dominated area. This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond futures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds and T-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing the MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options. Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT members. One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating. ""There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area,"" he said. The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at a time. ""The first step, after deciding the most effective way to proceed, would be to get architectural and engineering drawings,"" he said. He added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves. ""This is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year,"" he said. Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which merged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month.

The group said it wants the information so it can contact shareholders on issues, including election of an opposition slate of directors to the board and other proxy contests. The Koether group's letter gives the company five days to respond to its request. If there is no response from Prime Medical, the group said it would consider the demand refused and would take ""other proper steps"" to get the information. The group said it already holds 1,483,886 Prime Medical shares, or 17.5 pct of the total. It said it has taken legal action to try to force the company to set an annual meeting and require all directors to stand for election. In a previous SEC filing, the group has said it has decided to try to seek control of Prime Medical through a tender offer, exchange offer, proxy contest or other ways. Reuter "

Chrysler Corp's proposed acquisition of American Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs, including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs in American Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said. They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at 782 mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares. The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing Chrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company's agreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mln dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is not included valuing the transaction. Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposed purchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected the transaction would carry with it a short-term dilution in Chrysler's earnings. A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, told Reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it would have been had a deal been struck last year because the impact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability to assume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwards accumulated from its losses since 1980. ""There were very serious discussions last fall but we didn't pull it off,"" the source said in a reference to the assassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges Besse. ""It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor. And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd done it before the end of last year."" In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, the source said Chrysler would also assume any liability from lawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called ""an overhang to the company."" Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that the deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal in the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mln dlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25 mln dlrs in cash for ""transaction fees"" in connection with the acquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paid AMC shareholders. ""The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,"" analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters. Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12 billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal. But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC's liabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC debt that is being carried at ""non-market"" rates. He said there were difficulties in negotiating with the previous Renault management on the acquisition because they were committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was an integral part. ""The new management didn't have that problem - AMC wasn't their baby,"" he said. Reuter "
[u'philippines', u'ongpin']|"BANKS TO MULL PHILIPPINE DEBT PROPOSAL

The Philippines' bank advisory committee meets tomorrow to discuss its response to a novel proposal by finance minister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of the country's interest bill with investment notes instead of cash, bankers said. Ongpin outlined his plan today to the 12-bank advisory committee headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Bankers declined to comment on today's meeting but said the panel's response could be crucial to the fate of the talks, which are now in their second week. ""The ball's in our court now,"" one banker on the committee said. Under Ongpin's rescheduling plan, the Philippines would offer to make interest payments in cash at 5/8 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate. Banks which found this rate unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of LIBOR payments in cash plus a margin of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes, PINs, bankers explained. These tradable, dollar-denominated zero-coupon notes would have a maturity of six years, but they would be redeemable at any time at par for pesos to fund investments approved as part of the government's debt-equity scheme. Because banks would be able to sell the PINs to multinational investors at relatively small discounts to face value, their total yield would be boosted well above the 5/8 pct cash margin, according to the Philippine proposal. Although bankers are eager to foster foreign investment in the Philippines, the PINs idea is likely to run into stiff resistance by at least some members of the bank advisory committee because it would establish the precedent of some interest payments being made with paper rather than cash. Ongpin has said that U.S. regulators and accountants had given a green light to his idea, but bankers are not so sure. U.S. bankers fear that they would not be able to account for the notes in the same way as accruing cash interest payments and that their profits would suffer accordingly. If the banks reject the proposal out of hand, however, they run the risk of scuttling the talks, for Ongpin has insisted that he would not accept a margin above 5/8 pct. The Phillipines is asking the banks to reschedule 3.6 billion dlrs of debt falling due between 1987 and 1992 and to grant easier terms on 5.8 billion dlrs of previously restructured debt. Reuter "

Under the law, which is designed to combat the spread of nuclear weapons, foreign importers of U.S. nuclear fuel must get American consent to any reprocessing. The United States and EURATOM have had a series of 11 rounds of talks from 1978 to 1986 to renegotiate its nuclear cooperation agreements, signed more than 20 years ago, to conform with the 1978 law.

A 3.6 billion dlr plan to rid the European Community (EC) of one mln tonnes of surplus butter is in doubt as Spain and Portugal refuse to drop their opposition to the scheme, diplomats said. The plan, proposed by the Community's executive Commission, aims to level most of the EC's huge and costly butter mountain by disposing of a total of 1.04 mln tonnes this year and next. But the officials said Spain and Portugal, which joined the 12-nation bloc at the beginning of last year, continued to oppose the scheme at a meeting of EC finance ministers here. They argued they should not have to pay for the disposal of surpluses created before they became EC members. The plan, already approved by farm ministers despite opposition from Madrid and Lisbon, had been sent to finance ministers for final approval. But the diplomats said the finance ministers instead referred it back to the Commission, asking it to study possible ways to solve the row as soon as possible. They said Spain and Portugal indicated they may go to the European Court of Justice over the issue if the Commission did not come up with a satisfactory solution. The scheme has also run into criticism from the EC's financial watchdog, the Court of Auditors. The Court has said the plan is unsound because the Commission wants member states to foot the bill until it starts reimbursing them in four annual instalments from 1989. Diplomats said Spain and Portugal backed the court's view and also complained that, under complex financial agreements worked out when they joined the EC, they would get less back later than if they were reimbursed now. Commission sources said it appeared the two countries were holding out in a bid to squeeze some form of compensation out of their partners but it was unclear how much longer they would continue to block the scheme.

A confidential World Bank report on the Peruvian economy has said the government's strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure. The report, published today by the economic monthly, The Peru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcia's government in stimulating output last year to achieve a growth in gross domestic product of over eight pct ""represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long."" Government officials had no immediate comment on the report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment program and greater emphasis on the preservation of Peru's export potential. The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation program was encountering rising difficulties. ""An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls, appears not improbable,"" it added. The world bank report said the government's policies had reduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption at the apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of the currency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses, and sharply diminished creditworthiness. It said unless the government took action quickly to fix a competitive exchange rate and control the public sector deficit, ""the higher the probability will be that the government will eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment of domestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still further controls on imports in order to stem inflation and support the balance of payments."" It said the bank would place more emphasis on the preservation of peru's export potential, external links and overall economic efficiency. The government's incentive policies towards the mining and petroleum sectors, among its main traditional exports, suggested that it did not accord high priority to their economic viability, it added.

U.S. authorities intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasion during the period between the start of November 1986 and the end of January, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report. The Fed's quarterly review of foreign exchange operations said that the U.S. bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yen on January 28. This operation was coordinated with the Japanese monetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the U.S. Treasury. The Fed's intervention was on the morning after president Reagan's State of the Union message and was ""in a manner consistent with the joint statement"" made by U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa after their January 21 consultations. At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness to cooperate on exchange rate issues. The Fed's report did not say at what level the intervention occurred. But on January 28, the dollar closed at 151.50/60 yen after dipping as low as 150.40 yen earlier in the session. It had closed at 151.05/15 yen the previous day. The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 149.98 yen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 1.7675 marks on January 28. It ended that day at 1.7820/30 marks. The Fed noted that, after trading steadily throughout November and the first half of December, the dollar moved sharply lower until the end of January. It closed the three-month review period down more than 11 pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies and seven pct lower against the yen and sterling. It had fallen four pct against the Canadian dollar. During the final days of January, pressure on the dollar subsided. Reports of the U.S.-Japanese intervention operation and talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrial countries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation on exchange rate and economic policy matters, the Fed said. Moreover, doubts had developed about the course of U.S. interest rates. The dollar's swift fall had raised questions about whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease. Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 1.8320 marks and 153.70 yen. According to the Fed's trade-weighted index, it had declined nine pct since the beginning of the period. The dollar had risen as high as 2.08 marks and 165 yen in early November. The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market on November 7, 1985 when it bought a total of 102.2 mln dlrs worth of marks and yen.

The Soviet Union will likely honor its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department official said. ""They have always honoured the agreement, and there's no reason now to think they won't this year,"" he told Reuters. ""They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European Community, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyers from all sources at this point,"" the official said in explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes. This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for the first time in 15 years. A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S. corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow's recent interest. Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan, and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the official said. ""The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists"" and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. ""As soon as they need corn, they'll buy it,"" he added. USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.

""There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of frenetic buying now,"" the official said. However, the situation in wheat is ""a different story,"" he said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.

Pickens told Reuters he expects the rig count to drop to below 600 before recovering. He added that oil prices will eventually rise to 35 dlrs, then to 50 dlrs after 1990. Currently, some 700 oil rigs are operating in the U.S., down sharply after oil prices slipped from 30 dlrs in late 1985 to around 10 dlrs in 1986. Prices are now around 18 dlrs. The highest number of working rigs was 4,500 in December 1981. ""The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs,"" he said, adding that while he expects to see 50 dlr a barrel oil, he does not expect to see 2,000 rigs operating in his lifetime. Pickens is 58. Pickens, who is currently touring the country promoting his autobiography ""Boone,"" said he does not believe the U.S. should impose an oil import fee in order to stimulate the domestic oil industry.

[u'australia']|"AUSTRALIAN WAGE RISE SET AT 10 DLRS A WEEK

The Arbitration Commission awarded the Australian workforce a flat 10 dlrs a week wage increase and allowed trade unions to begin bargaining for a second-tier increase of up to four pct, Commission President Justice Barry Maddern said here. The decision is effective from the next pay period of individual employers, he said in delivering the Commission's National Wage Case decision. Full-time adult ordinary time weekly earnings are 453.00 dlrs a week for males and 428.40 dlrs for all adults, according to latest official statistics. The wage decision is the first under the previously announced two-tier system which replaced the concept of wage indexation. It is the first national wage rise since a partially-indexed increase of 2.3 pct was awarded by the Commission last July. The decision is a compromise between the Federal government's call at the Wage Case hearing for a 10 dlr weekly rise plus a three pct second-tier ceiling and the Australian Council of Trade Unions' (ACTU) claim of 20 dlrs and up to four pct. Employer groups had sought no rise at all. The Commission is willing to convene another Wage Case in October to establish if another wage increase of up to 1.5 pct should be awarded, Maddern said. He said the success of the new system depended on the commitment of all parties - employers, unions and governments. He said the Commission had rejected employers' calls for a freeze on overall labour cost increases. ""We do not think that such an outcome is feasible, given the needs and expectations of wage and salary earners,' he said, adding a freeze could have destroyed the possibility of a cooperative effort to lift Australia's economic performance. The decision would ensure the effects of the depreciation of the Australian dollar and the adverse terms of trade would not be reflected in wage increases, Maddern said. If necessary, it would arbitrate second-tier claims at an implementation rate of no more than two pct from September this year and a further two pct from July 1988, he said. He said labour cost rises would be phased in over the life of the package, adding that second-tier rises will be mainly achieved by a restructuring and efficiency principle, covering elimination of restrictive work practices, improved efficiency and productivity and reduction of demarcation disputes. Maddern said the Commission again ruled out claims for a cut in weekly working hours below 38 and allowed employers to be exempted from wage case decisions on the basis of severe or extreme economic adversity. The Commission said the poor economic outlook noted in its last decision had persisted, and was perhaps now more serious. ""The prevailing uncertainty and lack of confidence in the economy which underlines the economic circumstances must be allayed to halt further decline and to turn the economy around. In this connection, what happens to labour costs is of critical importance,"" he said. REUTER "

The leaf disease corenes pora, which has affected some rubber trees in Sri Lanka and Indonesia, is likely to force a cut in supply and push up depressed prices, a Malaysian rubber disease researcher said. Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be saved and must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protection and Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM), told Reuters. He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenes pora had hit seven pct of Sri Lanka's plantations and may cause output to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institute may ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by the disease and added that most estates affected belong to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affects certain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and that further use of such clones must be discontinued. Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka clone 103, Indonesia's PPN 2058, 2444, 2447 and PR 265 and Malaysia's RRIM 725, he said. Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725 clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbed after use of such clones were discontinued. Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which also affects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experience has proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added. ""The disease is extremely difficult to control. If it is not curbed in the two affected countries their rubber output may drop and prices can rise,"" he said.

Japan's Finance Ministry auctioned 1,000 billion yen worth of tankoku, six month debt-financing paper, to roll over previously issued tankoku maturing on March 19, a spokesman said. The last tankoku auction, on February 12, produced a record low yield of 3.383 pct, reflecting expectation of a half point cut in Japan's discount rate, he said. In the previous auction for 1,000 billion yen, four major Japanese securities houses took 92 pct of the issue amount in an attempt to meet strong demand from large institutional investors, securities managers said. Securities managers said they expect the auction to go well again this time as securities houses will try to expand their inventories of tankoku on continuing good response from institutional investors. Contrary to a projected low yield on tankoku, short-term interest rates have been resisting a fall on growing demand for funds ahead of the March 31 financial year-end, they said.

The search continued for a cargo of poisonous chemical substances loaded on the Herald of Free Enterprise Ferry which capsized in Zeebrugge harbour Friday. A total of 72 drums of various toxic materials which were loaded on trucks in the ship's hold have been recovered, but Belgian authorities warned it was essential to recover a further 61 containers of a cyanide-based solution. A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at the front of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out.

The ferry's owner is European Ferries Plc>, majority owned by Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc PORL.L>. The operation to right the vessel began yesterday after divers abandoned their search for more bodies.

Japanese microchip makers are being strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market to foreign chips, industry analysts said. But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space, they said. U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said. ""MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) associate vice president Peter Wolffe. Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject to the pact's price controls. The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said. U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan. But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp said it would cut production in line with MITI's request. ""NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's demands,"" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. ""Once NEC cuts production, it means they all have."" Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact. ""The best way to lower cost is to produce more,"" said Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec. Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt Aizawa said. Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new restrictions, some industry officials said. ""It's like tax avoidance schemes,"" said Steve Donovan, head of MMI Japan K.K. ""As soon as you close one route, another opens."" MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier shrugged off MITI guidance. ""It's getting to be like communism,"" said one. But analysts said output cuts could help by making it easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss. ""They're going to have to start running their businesses like businesses,"" Bache's Wolffe said. MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry officials said response has been mixed at best. ""There has been some change, but it's not across the board,"" said one U.S. Spokesman. ""The companies have a varying degree of urgency."" The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added. Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said. Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they said. Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S. Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing. Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S. Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said. ""The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't even have an office here,"" a source close to the industry said. ""You could question just how committed they are."" In addition, some industry analysts question the effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third country chipmakers such as those in South Korea.

According to the 230 mln stg contract, Lombard North Central, an affiliate of National Westminster Bank Plc NWBL.L>, will build and lease plants for engine assembly, body panel pressing and resin moulding by 1988. They will be near the existing Nissan plant in Sunderland in north-east England, Nissan said. The Sunderland plant currently produces 24,000 Bluebird cars annually for the British market. Nissan hopes to begin U.K. Exports to Europe in 1991 after building an engine machining plant which would boost output to 100,000 units a year and local content to above 80 pct, in accordance with EC requests, the spokesman said.

Iraq said today its forces had crushed an Iranian attack on a strategic mountain peak in a rugged and snow-clad area of Iraqi Kurdistan. The official Iraqi news agency INA said the attack was repelled yesterday by the Fifth Army Corps' 96th Brigade on ""Karda Ku"" peak, overlooking the northern post of Haj Omran and 340 kms north of Baghdad. INA said hundreds of Iranians were killed and large quantities of armour and weapons were left behind. It did not give Iraqi casualties. The Iranian news agency IRNA said yesterday that Iraqi troops had suffered 3,000 casualties in Iran's week-old offensive in northeast Iraq. Iran attacked across snow-capped peaks of northeastern Iraq last week in an area which saw heavy fighting in mid-1983. The thrust followed fierce battles near Basra, Iraq's second city on the southern front of the 6-1/2-year-old conflict, after an Iranian cross-border offensive launched on January 9. The political department head at Iraq's Defence Ministry, Abdul Jabbar Muhsen, said on Monday fighting was continuing in the north but that Iran had exaggerated battle reports.

A one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997 was exhausted in very early trading on the U.K. Government bond market only minutes after becoming available for trading, dealers said. The Bank of England said the issue, announced on Monday and available for official dealings from this morning, was no longer operating as a tap. The striking price was a partly paid 41 stg pct, at which price bids were allotted 53.8 pct. Dealers noted that strong demand had been detected for the bonds yesterday afternoon and interest was further stimulated by sterling's surge at the opening this morning. The issue was announced on Monday, when it was widely seen as a move by the authorities to brake market optimism for a further U.K. Interest rate reduction following the half-point cut in clearing bank base lending rates to 10.5 pct earlier in the day. Dealers said that the Bank's strategy succeeded in stemming pressure for a further rate reduction only briefly, as the market yesterday recovered all the ground it lost on Monday immediately after the announcement. Demand for the issue was lively from U.K. And overseas sources, with particular interest seen from Japan. The bonds were issued at a price of 96-16/32 stg pct, partly paid as to 40 stg pct on application, although the Government broker this morning sold them at a premium of one stg pct over the partly paid issue price. The issue has been designated the ""B"" tranche of the bonds, since 1.3 billion stg of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997 is already in issue. Dealers noted that the Bank of England last week issued one billion stg of nine pct Exchequer bonds due 2002 in an effort to dampen enthusiasm for an interest rate reduction caused by sterling's uptrend on foreign exchange markets. Last week's issue was sold out on its first day of dealings but with nothing resembling the determined demand seen this morning for the new tranche of bonds, dealers said. After stifling pressure for a rate cut last week, the authorities finally sanctioned a base rate reduction on Monday, following it up with the announcement of the one billion stg bond issue. Sterling was briefly depressed by the rate cut but this morning opened very strongly again, starting on a trade-weighted basis at 72.6 against yesterday's final 72.1 and later edging up to 72.7. U.K. Money market rates declined again this morning by up to 1/8 point, strongly reinforcing yesterday's speculation that clearing bank base lending rates could drop into single figures after the budget next Tuesday, money market dealers said. U.K. Government bond dealers noted that under the influence of stronger sterling and the further fall in money market rates, prices this morning had opened as much as 3/4 point higher at the longer end of the market.

[u'bop', u'china']|"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA'S FOREIGN DEBT UP

China's foreign debt reached 27 billion dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to short-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign bankers and Chinese officials told Reuters. Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply from an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low, between eight and 10 pct. China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said. Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on 1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct. Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion. A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too much short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive low interest rates in the Japanese market. The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said. A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the country's total debt at about 30 pct. The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares. ""Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China, which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread,"" he said. The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is in part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capital markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s. ""Officials do not think of China but of their own department or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the full backing of the People's Republic of China,"" he said. ""The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to exercise indirect controls,"" he said. The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the past six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not be affected by a drive against ""bourgeois liberalism,"" a phrase meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16. A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China's foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially stated figure of 10 billion dlrs. ""The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in advance of an announcement the reserves were down,"" he said. The banker said such buying has not been going on. ""Things are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in 1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development."" Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985. A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official said this year's outlook for exports, which account for more than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier than a year ago. The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It was quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago. The official said China has taken measures to improve its export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and the establishment of export production bases. ""We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year,"" he added. Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from the drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs. A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs careful management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six to eight pct. ""We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchange reserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a company on its performance, not its bank account,"" he said. He said China performed very well in the export field last year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have few difficulties in increasing its borrowing. REUTER "

Ultramar Plc UMAR.L> said that while its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point of view, several special charges adversely affected results. Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstream operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and downstream operations also affected in the first half by large losses on inventories. But margins improved in the second half and in particular refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good recovery. The company was commenting on results that showed a net loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in 1985. The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquid natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership of Gulf Canada's marketing assets. Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a 13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its U.S. Flag shipping operation. The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic prices would strengthen over the longer term. Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery. In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improve profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while strengthening core businesses and developing a sound operational and financial base. Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis. Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from 181p at last night's close.

The European Community (EC) Commission declined to give an official reaction to reports that a group of european operators plan to offer one mln tonnes of sugar into intervention in protest at Commission export policies. However, a spokesman for the Commission confirmed the offers had been made to intervention agencies in various member states, and said it would now take up to three weeks for the agencies concerned to complete all necessary documentation. The spokesman said that under current regulations, the EC would have to accept all the offers if there were no technical problems. The spokesman said the Commission would only have to reimburse the member state for the cost of buying-in the sugar after the product was sold out of intervention stores at a later date. He said that at present there was virtually no sugar held in intervention stores. Last year, 45,000 tonnes were sold into intervention and during the 1984-85 campaign 108,000 tonnes. REUTER "

A tight money market has pushed interest rates on three to six month time deposits to between 15 and 18 pct from 13 to 15 pct a month ago, bankers said. March is usually a tight month for the money market because of tax payments and banks' need to attract funds for their year-end accounts on March 31. This year the situation has been made worse by December's rush to buy dollars by companies and businessmen who feared imposition of exchange controls. Much of that outflow has yet to be converted back into rupiah. ""A lot of small money has come back in, but the big money is holding out until after April,"" one U.S. Banker said. The tight money policy of Bank Indonesia, the central bank, is helping to keep rates high. Short-term lending rates now average 25 pct a year, with no prospect they will be lowered soon, the bankers said. Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar said earlier this week that Indonesia could look forward to better economic prospects in 1987/88, but added the ""speculators"" who led a run on the rupiah late last year could again pose problems. Indonesia holds general elections on April 23, the first in five years, and most businessmen expect no new government economic packages or incentives before then. ""Some people are nervous about what the government will do after the election,"" one banker said. ""They normally try to do things before the IGGI (Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia) meeting (in June) to prove they are doing something about the economy to show they deserve a couple of billion dollars.""

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will step down only after his plan to overhaul Japan's tax system gets parliamentary approval, one of his closest aides said today. The aide, who declined to be identified, said at a private meeting, ""Nakasone's power in office does not necessarily terminate at the end of his term in October. It depends on when (the) seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval."" Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despite Sunday's unexpected Upper House by-election defeat of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a conservative stronghold. The socialist winner, backed by other opposition parties, had campaigned against a controversial five pct value added sales tax, the main plank of the reform plans. The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of the sales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demanding nothing but retraction of the tax. They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the 1987 fiscal year starting on April 1, which includes the tax plans. They have been resorting to an on-off boycott of parliament since February 4. ""If I were Nakasone, I would close the current regular parliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled, attend the Venice summit of industrial democracies in June and open an extraordinary session to discuss the tax plans,"" the aide said. Under law, a regular session can be extended only once while an extraordinary session can be extended twice.The other option would be to extend the current session, he said. ""The opposition parties will surely present a no-confidence motion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another."" One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening up the way for tax reform. ""Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabinet en masse. A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower House for a snap general election,"" the aide said. That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resign from the 512-seat Lower House, necessitating by-elections. The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after its landslide victory in general elections last July. There are five independents and three vacancies. ""The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflate their seats, but at the expense of fierce media criticism,"" the aide said. He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have little effect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26. About 2,600 elections will be held in all but three of the nation's 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections. ""Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will all oppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets.

A spokesman for Preussag AG PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay a dividend on 1986 results He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following a difficult year in 1985. Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board. The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the group's other divisions. The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions. Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before. The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before. Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln. The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector. The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results. Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year. Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG. Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison figures. Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0 pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes. Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC) subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year. AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by the international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world group losses that year. REUTER "

South Korea will further open its market to help cut its trade surplus with the U.S. And to fight off pressure to revalue the won against the dollar, a government spokesman said. The spokesman said Korean trade minister Rha Woong-Bae's stand in Washington yesterday against pressure from industrial nations to revalue the won underlined the government's determination to stand firm. Rha told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ""Demands that Korea carry out a drastic and sudden currency revaluation of five or 10 pct are, I believe, extremely ill-advised."" Deputy prime minister Kim Mahn-Je told a meeting of local businessmen ""The government's policy on the question of revaluing the won is to maintain a steadfast position."" Kim said South Korea was ready to move slowly to raise the won's value because of its heavy foreign debt which stood at 44.5 billion dlrs at the end of 1986. Six industrialised nations agreed in Paris last month that newly industrialising countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, should allow their currencies to appreciate. But local businessmen have said won/dollar parity has already reached ""a crisis level."" An official of the Korea Traders' Association (KTA) said if the won strengthened another five pct, this would mean the loss of profitability for nearly half of all South Korean exporters. ""We are determined not to go the way of Latin American debtor nations which have suspended interest payments of their debts,"" the spokesman said. ""The only way to keep our good record is to maintain our exports.+ The trade minister said yesterday should Seoul revalue the won suddenly Korea would run ""a tremendous trade deficit and could degenerate into a country, like many other developing countries, which is reneging on its international obligations."" The spokesman said South Korea had been gradually appreciating its currency, ruling out a major revaluation. So far this year, the won has gone up by 0.8 pct against the dollar after a 3.34 pct revaluation in 1986. He said South Korea was selecting ""many"" of 122 items on which Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. No further details were given. Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158 items, including sensitive agricultural products and large cars, effective from July. South Korea posted its first ever current account surplus last year, due largely to a trade surplus with the U.S. Of 7.1 billion dlrs, against a 4.3 billion deficit in 1985.

Banks built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow. The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as an earlier securities repurchase pact matured. Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six billion marks. The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to redeem them meant a net infusion was needed.

Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled 53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the first nine days of March.

Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- have attracted a large influx of speculative foreign capital which is threatening the government's monetary targets. They say this influx is largely responsible for Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP), to have grown by an estimated 17 pct annualised rate in February, compared with January's 8.3 pct rise and an 11.4 pct rise during the whole of 1986. The target for 1987 is eight pct. The Bank of Spain today did not provide assistance funds to banks in a move to drain excess liquidity from the money market. Liquidity will be further tightened by the fortnightly Treasury Bill auction tomorrow and Friday's hike in reserve requirements, expected to absorb over 200 billion pesetas from the system. The immediate reaction was a hike in interbank interest rates today to 13.75/14.00 pct from yesterday's 13.46 pct average for deposits. Bank of Spain officials said this was an understandable response ""given that the market is short of funds."" But banking sources noted that a continued rise in interest rates would neutralize the central bank's attempts to curtail short-term speculation with foreign funds by making the Spanish money markets more attractive.

Iraq said today its forces had crushed an Iranian attack on a strategic mountain peak in a rugged and snow-clad area of Iraqi Kurdistan. The official Iraqi news agency INA said the attack was repelled yesterday by the Fifth Army Corps' 96th Brigade on ""Karda Ku"" peak, overlooking the northern post of Haj Omran and 340 kms north of Baghdad. INA said hundreds of Iranians were killed and large quantities of armour and weapons were left behind. It did not give Iraqi casualties. The Iranian news agency IRNA said yesterday that Iraqi troops had suffered 3,000 casualties in Iran's week-old offensive in northeast Iraq. Iran attacked across snow-capped peaks of northeastern Iraq last week in an area which saw heavy fighting in mid-1983. The thrust followed fierce battles near Basra, Iraq's second city on the southern front of the 6-1/2-year-old conflict, after an Iranian cross-border offensive launched on January 9. The political department head at Iraq's Defence Ministry, Abdul Jabbar Muhsen, said on Monday fighting was continuing in the north but that Iran had exaggerated battle reports. He said Tehran had done this ""to make up for failure in the south and to encourage anti-Baghdad Kurdish rebels to support its troops.""

[u'interest', u'usa', u'philippines']|"U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN

The U.S. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy, a Reagan administration official said. The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms. In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a ""megabank,"" where Third World debt would be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the same time, however, the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground. The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine suggestions that ""exit bonds"" be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan, the official said in an interview with Reuters. ""All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered,"" said the official, who asked not to be named. In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations. In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth. ""The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors have been performing well,"" said the official. But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an exception. The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker, also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis. ""We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively,"" the official said. Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that commercial banks create a ""megabank"" which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called ""exit bonds"" for banks like regional American or European institutions. Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs. He emphasised that the ""megabank"" was not an administration plan but ""something some people have suggested."" Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would differ slightly from the one the official described. But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States. ""If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go, fine. I don't think they ever will."" He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution. Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct above Libor. ""The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand,"" the official said. Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes. These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point over Libor. Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt. But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the banks. ""It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before,"" the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek. ""Some people argue that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money,"" he added. He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines'. Reuter "

Interest in the currency futures market has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies, analysts said. The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the dollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom. ""Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and technically, the pound is in the best shape,"" PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said. ""We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and we're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change,"" Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said. Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark futures positions, although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday, Sloane said. The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have been relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy, analysts said. ""Money seems to be chasing yields,"" William Byers, of Bear Stearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate. Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17. The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how well it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency. However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K. interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloane said. The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon. The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with smaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a ""bull flag"" on price charts, technically-oriented analysts said. ""It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout,"" in this case to the upside, Sloane said. Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar. ""At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-term positive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above (the previous contract high of) 75.25,"" Byers said. As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts. Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400, respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430. Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada. ""We may still probe to see what the parameters are,"" Byers said, ""but people are very reluctant because they don't know where the central banks will be (to intervene)."" Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at that level. Reuter "

The Parliament later registered its support for the Delors plan by voting to approve his continuation in office for a second two-year term.

Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said. Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies. ""Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils,"" Balletto said. Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln tonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output. He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance at 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln. Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said, disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976. ""If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the crush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop,"" he said. ""This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds,"" Balletto said. Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies, he said. World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes, compared with 25.4 mln last year. The increase should result from lower disappearance, as production is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7 mln last year, he said. World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln tonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said, while production of other oilseeds was lower. Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States, he said. Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S. stocks make up most of those, Balletto said. The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes, about half of the world soybean surplus, he said. Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased 13.1 mln tonnes. ""During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1 mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the U.S. loan program."" ""Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long as the U.S. soybean surplus continues. For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the U.S. loan program. ""Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the U.S. loan rate."" The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said. Reuter "

Brazil's central bank governor Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country's unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said. Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head of Brazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc. High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil's accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines, the bankers said. Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed last March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, as part of a 31 billion dlr financing package. Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled with Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros. They said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another. The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower interest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would rather accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the central bank. ""It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,"" one banker said.

Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney announced a major shakeup in the ranks of his key advisers after weeks of continuing criticism of his government.

Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government, shaken by a series of cabinet resignations and allegations of corruption, has been trailing the opposition parties for months in public opinion polls. The prime minister, who led the Conservatives to a landslide victory in the 1984 general election, had been urged by party loyalists to make major changes within his office.

The borrowing limit of the Hong Kong Exchange Fund, set up to regulate the value of the Hong Kong dollar, has been raised to 50 billion H.K. Dlrs from 30 billion by the legislature, an official statement said. The limit governs total borrowing by the fund from the government's general revenue account and various funds as well as borrowing by the fund arising from money market operations. The bulk of the government's fiscal surplus is invested by the Treasury with the exchange fund against the issue by the fund of interest-bearing debt certificates, Financial Secretary Piers Jacobs said. ""At the close of the business today, the total amount of debt certificates issued by the Exchange Fund in return for money transferred from the general revenue account and the various funds, in other words the total borrowing by the Exchange Fund from these sources, will be 26.9 billion dlrs,"" Jacobs said. He said borrowing arising from money market operations would amount to an additional 2.9 billion dlrs, making a total of 29.8 billion dlrs, just short of the borrowing limit of 30 billion dlrs. Jacobs said the government's fiscal reserves are expected to total 32 billion dlrs by the end of the current fiscal year ending March 31. ""The current borrowing limit of 30 billion dlrs will, therefore, constrain the ability of the Exchange Fund to continue to take in these fiscal reserves by the issue of interest-bearing debt certificates,"" he said.

[u'usa', u'reagan']|"OFFICIAL SAYS REAGAN OPPOSES SECURITIES TAX

The Reagan administration is totally opposed to recent Democratic suggestions that securities transactions should be taxed to help curb the budget deficit, an administration official said in an interview. ""We're totally opposed to a securities transfers tax. It would impair the efficiency of some of the most efficient markets in the world,"" he said. He declined to be named. In recent days House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, has called for such a tax to raise the 20 billion dlrs he estimates is needed to meet legal deficit reduction targets. ""It would fall primarily in my view not on wealthy individuals but on middle income people who occasionally invest and trade. So I think it's a very bad idea,"" said the official, who is an administration economic policy-maker. The official also rejected a suggestion by Wright that the administration delay next year's cut in top tax rates, called for in the recently-passed overhaul of the U.S. Tax system. ""It is breaking faith with the American people ... It would be a real breach of faith,"" he said. The Gramm-Rudman Hollings law calls for a balanced budget by 1991, but its power has been reduced in the Supreme Court. Wright and other Democrats say even if they pass President Reagan's budget proposals for the fiscal year starting this October, they would miss by some 20 billion dlrs the 108 billion dlr target for the budget deficit set under the Gramm-Rudman law. The administration puts the deficit at 173.2 billion dlrs in the current fiscal year and claims that spending cuts and revenue increases will achieve the Gramm-Rudman goal. The official, who is knowlegeable on budget strategy, also said President Reagan was still opposed to a so-called 'budget summit' with Congress to resolve the deficit issue. The suggestion of a 'budget summit' emerged again recently after Democrats and Republicans alike said Reagan needed a deficit reduction package and an arms control accord with Moscow to rebuild his presidency after the Iran arms scandal. But the official dismissed the budget summit idea as an attempt by the Democrats to secure a tax increase. He accused them of being overly critical before they had written their own budget proposal, due out on April 1. ""It's easier to write a book review than it is to write a book.

The International Monetary Fund has warned Israel in a report that a continued rapid rise in wages could undo the achievements of its economic stabilization program in controlling hyperinflation. An IMF delegation, which visited Israel this week, issued an interim report praising Israel's success in slashing inflation from 440 pct in 1985 to 19.7 pct last year without triggering mass unemployment. But it held up Argentina and Brazil as examples of the perils awaiting countries who did not follow up on stabilization programs. ""Continued rapid rise in wages would threaten the progress in reducing inflation and the present level of employment,"" the IMF said. The report echoed warnings last week by Bank of Israel Governor Michael Bruno and the private Bank Hapoalim that higher wages, government overspending and a consumer boom were rekindling inflation. ""Though wage developments and the reacceleration of inflation are worrisome, there is still time to put the stabilization program back on track,"" it said. The warning comes ahead of Israel's key public sector wage negotiations next month. Bank Hapoalim chief economist Petahia Bar-Shavit said real growth of wages in 1986 was about 10 pct, following a fall of between 15 and 20 pct in the second half of 1985 when the government's economic stabilisation programme was introduced. Hapoalim forecast last week that inflation would rise to around 30 pct this year and a second devaluation might be necessary later in the year, following the 9.75 pct devaluation against the dollar in January. Bar-Shavit also said the government was implementing a policy of cutting taxes without a clear strategy for balancing the budget.

U.S. banks and savings and loan institutions could face important changes as a result of emergency legislation adopted overwhelmingly by the Senate Banking Committee. The bill approved 12-6 yesterday would rescue the underfunded federal deposit insurance fund for thrifts and temporarily halt new developments in the provision of financial services. The bill, which goes to the full Senate, will infuse a badly needed 7.5 billion dlrs into the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures accounts of depositors. It also limits banks' ability to sell securities and restricts a new breed of competitor, the so-called nonbank banks. Committee Chairman William Proxmire, the bill's sponsor, promised the committee will work on a long-term plan for new developments in the financial services industry, which is confronted by growing competition from firms in other commercial centers, such as London and Tokyo. ""This bill we are taking up today is the first step in this effort,"" the Wisconsin Democrat said. But Sen. Jake Garn, the committee's top Republican, chastised senators for imposing temporary restrictions on financial providers. ""It is time to forget the special interests,"" the Utah senator said. Garn failed to win approval for an amendment that would have eliminated virtually all of the bill's provisions except the rescue for FSLIC. A major controversy focused on nonbank banks, which offer limited financial services of a bank and avoid most banking regulations. Proxmire succeeded in closing a loophole which would permit new nonbank banks and thrifts until Congress passes comprehensive bank reform, a move welcomed by the bank industry. But at the same time, the bill set a moratorium on a number of new activities that banks may undertake, including selling insurance, securities and real estate for one year after the bill becomes law. The 7.5 billion dlr rescue for FSLIC represented a compromise between a larger amount sought by the Reagan administration and a smaller figure proposed by the thrift industry. The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, an industry group, feared approval of a larger amount for FSLIC would lead to a surge of closings of thrifts by federal superviors. ""We hope the Congress will finally settle on a lower number,"" William O'Connell, president of the league, said after the committee voted. Reuter "

The oil services industry is on the verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil industry analysts said. The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the first half, and continue into the next decade. ""People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go up to start buying,"" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc. Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd SLB>, Halliburton Co HAL>, Dresser Industries DI>, Baker International BKO>, and McDermott International Inc MDR>, which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based investor. Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in oil services will begin in the U.S. ""Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up faster,"" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs. The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766 last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co HT> figures show. The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. ""The first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the second half of 1988,"" Kerridge said. Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar pattern, Kerridge said. ""Halliburton is the best value,"" said Jeffrey Freedman, vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess, and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash flow including debt. Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service stock. ""Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant technical leader in the industry,"" Freedman said. ""Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring, including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on the project upturn in exploration and development activity,"" according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at Robert W. Baird and Co Inc. Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25 cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87 billion dlrs. Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil service companies and said choosing among them is difficult. Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a possible merger with Hughes Tool Co. Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a pure service company, Sweeney said.

Creditanstalt-Bankverein CABV.VI> is likely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12 pct of share capital, deputy general-director Guido Schmidt-Chiari said. The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's share capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986 from 2.7 billion a year earlier. Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985. Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast. The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion. General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last year's better profits had resulted from improvements in services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling lending. Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when compared with those in other countries, he said. Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits, Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure. Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations, removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet total. In an attempt to generate more foreign business, representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and drawing dividends. Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers said improved results had been widely expected by investors.

OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said. He told a news conference here ""After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices."" Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned. ""We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February,"" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said. Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva. The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs. Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level. ""The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,"" Lukman said. He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd. Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement, while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said. ""If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs,"" the group's president said. He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely. ""Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to,"" he said. Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied ""We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials."" Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude. ""We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,"" Lukman said. The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market. ""We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly,"" he said.

St. Joe Gold Corp said it plans to proceed with development of its Golden Patricia gold property in northwestern Ontario. It said about five mln dlrs will be spent to continue underground development and obtain operating permits and another 10.2 mln dlrs is expected to be required to complete underground development, construct a mill and provide the infrastructure needed to put the mine into commercial production. St. Joe Gold said if the necessary operating permits were granted in time, it would start gold production in the second half of the year ending October 31, 1988 at an annual rate of about 40,000 troy ounces. The company said the property is estimated to contain over 500,000 troy ounces of gold, and the initial mining project covers only seven of 192 claims, with drill-indicated reserves of 293,000 short tons grading 0.88 troy ounce of gold per ton. It said initial mine output is expected to be about 150 tons of ore daily.

Senators and a special prosecutor were in dispute today over a legal maneuver to force quick answers from key figures in the Iran arms scandal and the diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels. Senators on a special Senate committee investigating the scandal want to grant limited immunity from prosecution to force early testimony from Lt. Col. Oliver North and John Poindexter. North is the National Security Council (NSC) aide President Reagan fired November 25 for possibly illegal diversion of Iran arms payments to the so-called contra rebels. Poindexter, who was NSC director and North's boss, resigned the same day. The Washington Post said over the weekend that Poindexter was ready to testify that he told Reagan twice of the funds diversion, contrary to Reagan's denial that he knew of it.

Walsh said he was also urging the committees to delay granting immunity for a third key figure, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, a close North associate.

National Bank of Hungary first vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year's severe trade deficit with the West. Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade. ""It is useful to have a devaluation,"" he said. ""There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports."" The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today. Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow. He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5.5 pct in 1986). This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s, he added. Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year. But the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3 mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985. Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs. One Western commercial attache here said: ""Devaluation of itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods."" Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry. It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market. Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen. He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation. ""I am for credits to invest for that purpose,"" he said. ""I am against credits for consumption."" He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986. Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he considered rates to be low. Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints.

Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry following last week's earthquake, officials said. Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports. Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after 180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs. The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota, set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987. ""All options are open at this moment in the context of cooperation on oil production,"" a Venezuelan energy and mines ministry source said. Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the pipeline is repaired, officials said. Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at technical level, officials said. Industry sources said that among the options are for Venezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply Ecuador's Far Eastern clients. But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made in due course. Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired.

The U.S. merchandise trade deficit on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said. The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15 billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs. For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said. During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78 billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs. The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and insurance. The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose 1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each. Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18 pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars and a nine pct decrease from Japan. On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports. Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were limited by drought. Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700 mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200 mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter. The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries, including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell 500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter. In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3 billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs. Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6 billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs from 26.41 dlrs. Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell 27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and soybeans nine pct. The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1 billion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe increased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs. Reuter "

Chrysler Corp's 1.5 billion dlr bid to takeover American Motors Corp AMO> should help bolster the small automaker's sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000 employees in doubt, industry analysts say. It was ""business as usual"" yesterday at the American Motors headquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled by Chrysler and AMC's French parent Renault, according to company spokesman Edd Snyder. But AMC's future, to be discussed at a board meeting today, would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than if it had continued with the state-run French car group as its controlling shareholder. Industry analysts said the future of AMC's car assembly plant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant would be in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North American auto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass. Both plants are far from ""state of the art"" for car manufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor labor relations at each. ""Chrysler doesn't need that many new plants,"" said Michael Luckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm Shearson Lehman Brothers. ""They probably will close the Toledo plant and move Jeep production to Canada."" Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at the very least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able to wring concessions from the United Automobile Workers union local representing Jeep workers. ""The UAW won't be able to hold them up for ransom as they have AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will have underutilized facilities to transfer production,"" he said. Analysts said they foresaw no major complications that would abort a combination which historians said would be the auto industry's biggest merger since American Motors was formed in 1954. AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its losses of more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in France for Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it could not forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at the earliest. In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mln dlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of 1,200 dealers as the major attractions. Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventually to sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overhead costs in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incur in the AMC buyout.

Bilfinger und Berger-Bau AG GBFG.F> expects group construction output in 1987 to fall to around 2.5 billion marks in 1987 from 2.73 billion last year and sees foreign business stabilizing just under its 1986 level. In a letter to shareholders, Bilfinger und Berger said foreign construction work fell to 1.37 billion marks in 1986 from 2.10 billion the year before. It said the drop was due to a fall in orders and the dollar's decline against the mark. The firm expects good 1986 results, with an appropriate dividend. In 1985 group net profit fell to 14.1 mln marks from 22.6 mln in 1984 and the dividend lost one mark to nine marks. Bilfinger und Berger's U.S. Units took up 600 mln marks of its total foreign construction output. The company said domestic earnings in 1986 improved slightly despite strong competition, due to efforts to avoid taking on orders which would not break even. Foreign earnings were hit by the lower dollar and temporary payment difficulties by clients.

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will step down only after his plan to overhaul Japan's tax system gets parliamentary approval, one of his closest aides said today. The aide, who declined to be identified, said at a private meeting, ""Nakasone's power in office does not necessarily terminate at the end of his term in October. It depends on when (the) seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval."" Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despite Sunday's unexpected Upper House by-election defeat of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a conservative stronghold. The socialist winner, backed by other opposition parties, had campaigned against a controversial five pct value added sales tax, the main plank of the reform plans. The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of the sales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demanding nothing but retraction of the tax. They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the 1987 fiscal year starting on April 1, which includes the tax plans. They have been resorting to an on-off boycott of parliament since February 4. ""If I were Nakasone, I would close the current regular parliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled, attend the Venice summit of industrial democracies in June and open an extraordinary session to discuss the tax plans,"" the aide said. Under law, a regular session can be extended only once while an extraordinary session can be extended twice.The other option would be to extend the current session, he said. ""The opposition parties will surely present a no-confidence motion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another."" One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening up the way for tax reform. ""Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabinet en masse. A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower House for a snap general election,"" the aide said. That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resign from the 512-seat Lower House, necessitating by-elections. The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after its landslide victory in general elections last July. There are five independents and three vacancies. ""The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflate their seats, but at the expense of fierce media criticism,"" the aide said. He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have little effect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26. About 2,600 elections will be held in all but three of the nation's 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections. ""Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will all oppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets. ""Possible effects, if any, will be on gubernatorial elections in Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido and Fukuoka in southern Japan,"" he said.

The stock jumped 2-1/2 to 98-3/4. Smith said the company ended 1986 with a strong cash position of about 639 mln dlrs as compared to 158 mln dlrs the year before. ""This implies the possibility of a share buyback, or significant dividend increase or a stock split,"" he said. In addition, he said the company has been gradually adjusting its merchandise mix and its gross margins have been improving. Smith expects the company to earn 8.25-to-8.50 dlrs a share in 1987 as compared to the 7.06 dlrs a share earned last year. Last year's results include a 69 cent charge for the buyback of debt.

[u'interest', u'uk']|"NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER U.K. RATES

U.K. Interest rates look set to move lower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to 10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension of a British National Savings issue yesterday. The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury Department unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched in October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the market. The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, the second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted. They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts issue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct downpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than later. The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due 1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward pressure on money market rates remained intact, with the bellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at 10-9-7/8 pct. It coincided with another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar. ""That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed,"" said Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew; ""It is an indication that the market believes rates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point immediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people hope for more."" Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the National Savings Department was ""of considerable significance."" It said, ""the real message ... Is that the decks are being quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises."" Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a reduction in mortgage lending rates. Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut. ""National Savings has been competing too effectively with the building societies of late. Building society income has been depressed in recent months,"" he said. He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid on U.K. Inflation. Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after last year's 3.7 pct. Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct. But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been complaining to the government about intense competition from National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early mortgage rate cuts. ""The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the building societies' criticism to heart. It looks like the National Savings move reflects this,"" one senior dealer said. A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with the rest of the market. ""We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just becoming too expensive and we don't need all that money,"" he told Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues at least twice in the past, when offered interest rates were above or below market rates. He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as U.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31. In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving's contribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg, compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the previous year, official figures show. Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the total for 11 months above target, government officials said. REUTER "

The Farmers Home Administration, the U.S. Agriculture Department's farm lending arm, could lose about seven billion dlrs in outstanding principal on its severely delinquent borrowers, or about one-fourth of its farm loan portfolio, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said. In remarks prepared for delivery to the Senate Agriculture Committee, Brian Crowley, senior associate director of GAO, also said that a preliminary analysis of proposed changes in FmHA's financial eligibility standards indicated as many as one half of FmHA borrowers who received new loans from the agency in 1986 would be ineligible under the proposed system. The agency has proposed evaluating applicants' credit using a variety of financial ratios instead of relying solely on cashflow ability. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) slammed the proposed eligibility changes, telling FmHA Administrator Vance Clark at a hearing that they would mark a ""dramatic shift"" in the agency's purpose away from being farmers' lender of last resort toward becoming a ""big city bank."" But Clark defended the new regulations, saying the agency had a responsibility to administer its 70-billion dlr loan portfolio in a ""compassionate yet judicious manner.""

Belgian Budget Minister Guy Verhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in several state-owned enterprises, including national airline Sabena and the postal and telecommunications authority, government sources said. They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francs in revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadt's projections, helping the government to reduce its huge budget deficit, targetted this year at 418 billion francs. But the scheme had received a guarded reception from the Social Christian parties in Belgium's centre-right coalition when Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday. Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult, the sources said.

It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year, Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal. The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986. The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha, against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln.

Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987/88.

Martin Sosnoff, who has offered to buy Caesars World Inc for 28 dlrs a share, said senior officials of the company have offered to buy back the Caesars stake he already holds, now 13.6 pct of the total outstanding. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, said the offers to buy back his stock occurred ""on several occasions during the past year."" The offers were made by several Caesars World representatives, including its chairman, Henry Gluck, he said. Sosnoff said he rejected all of the proposals. The Caesars World official suggested various forms of payment for Sosnoff's stake, including other securities of the company and cash, he said. Sosnoff did not detail the value of the proposed compensation. Also suggested was a deal involving ""put"" and ""call"" option regarding Sosnoff's Caesars World holdings, he said. The proposed deals would have also included a ""standstill"" agreement, which would have restricted Sosnoff's right to buy more Caesars World stock or ""to take any action adverse to incumbent management,"" he said. Sosnoff's report on the offers he received for his Caesars World shares were amended to his official offer to purchase the company, as well as reported to the SEC.

[u'crude', u'nat-gas', u'usa']|"ENERGY/FOREIGN INVESTORS

Lured by the weakening dollar and the conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said. They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable United States is good insurance against future shortages. However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S. institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice domestic oil properties. Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research. ""Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but we're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,"" said Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn. ""Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,"" he added. Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to buy new reserves than to explore for them. Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and general restructuring throughout the oilpatch. In two of the biggest transactions of recent months, French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to separately acquire oil assets of Texas International TEICC> and Lear Petroleum Partners LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome said the company is searching for additional acquisitions. A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, Petrofina S.A.> and Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos WMB>, the Oklahoma pipeline firm. But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's TX> Texaco USA in a 100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with Dupont's DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal. Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula. Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of Preussag Corp> and C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months. But he called that a small amount compared to the amount other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties. ""The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil companies,"" he said. ""Our company is shopping around because we feel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If you're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need prices higher than the current market,"" he added. In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also competing for prime properties. Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said. ""Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these companies,"" Smith said. ""Domestic production has dropped by one mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988."" Reuter "

Last year, about 18 pct of the utility's revenues came from New Mexico, 70 pct from retail electricity sales in Texas and 12 pct from wholesale sales under federal regulation. In January the company filed a formal rate case with New Mexico regulators seeking a 21.66 pct increase in its annual rates there which would have been equal to about 13.9 mln dlrs net of fuel savings. El Paso Electric said it reached a stipulated settlement on its New Mexico rates with several parties, including the state of the New Mexico Public Service Commission, which provides for rate treatment of the utility's investment in the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station located near Phoenix, Ariz. The company said commission hearings on the stipulated settlement are expected to start next month. If it is approved, the new rates could go into effect as early as this summer. El Paso Electric's January rate case will remain before the commission pending approval of the settlement. El Paso Electric said the agreement provides got continued full inclusion in its rate base of the costs of Palo Verda Unit one, maximum rate increases of three pct on a cents per kilowatt hour basis in 1987, 1988 and 1989, and no further rate increases until 1994. Once the agreement is approved, the utility would still have to prove cost of service increases to support at least the maximum increase each year, a spokesman explained. The company said it will attempt to settle the cost of service issues in timed to allow the new rates to go into effect this summer. El Paso Electric said the agreement allows recovery in its New Mexico rates of lease payments in connection with the utility's 1986 sale and leaseback of its investment in Palo Verde Unit Two to the extent of the book value sold. The company said it agreed that none of its costs for Palo Verde Unit Three will be included in its New Mexico rates. The utility said the agreement also resolves any issue relating to the prudence of the planning, management and construction of Palo Verde and settles any possible issue of excess generating capacity through 1993. El Paso Electric said it does not expect to have excess generating capacity. The agreement also provides that any portion of the cost of service deferrals not recouped prior to December 31, 1994 will not be recovered through New Mexico rates, the company said, adding it expects to recoup all deferrals in full by that date.

Several trading firms had asked for a delay in the start-up of the evening session so that the firms can work out operational difficulties created by the off-hours session. CBT chairman Karsten Mahlmann said in a statement the delay will ""afford all firms the time necessary to be 100 pct ready for this innovative program, we are postponing the opening date."" The board of directors accepted yesterday's recommendation by a committee of members overseeing the planned evening session, which was originally scheduled to start April 2. The session is designed to begin the global trading day from 1800 to 2100 local Chicago time Monday through Thursday. CBT members overwhelmingly approved the evening session in a vote conducted a month ago. But before night trading can begin, the CBT still has to obtain approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Pending regulatory approval, the CBT plans to offer evening trading in the world's most active futures contract, Treasury bonds, along with Treasury note futures and options on those contracts.

U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said Congress should consider legislation to apply the so-called 0/92 option to producers of major commodities. Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he thought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration, ""should be seriously considered"" because a refusal to do so could ""play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls"" placed on production. However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92 option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much they planted. The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two problems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. In addition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm bill, Dole said. Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export enhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union could help improve U.S. relations with that country. Dole said that the United States has made the decision to trade with Moscow and that it's important to offer competitive prices. The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy program, which currently targets benefits to recapture markets lost to other suppliers which subsidize. Dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to require a marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again called for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains. The Reagan administration's proposed farm policy changes ""are not going anywhere"" this year, Dole said, singling out the proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year. Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a shift in the State Department towards supporting an export enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union, Dole said he didn't see any change. Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year.

Chrysler Corp today sold 405 mln dlrs of corporate bonds from its nearly 3.5 billion dlr pension fund to Wall Street investment bankers, vice president and treasurer Fred Zuckerman said. He said this was the first of two planned sales of corporate issues from the fund's portfolio. Zuckerman said Chrysler will sell slightly less than one billion dlrs of corporates. ""Phase two (the second sale) will be in a month or so,"" the Chrysler executive said, adding that proceeds will be invested exclusively in the equities market. Before today's sale of corporate bonds, those securities had comprised roughly two thirds of the pension fund portfolio. ""After the two sales, equities will amount to 50 pct or more of the portfolio,"" Zuckerman said. ""We believe that the equity market has much more upside potential than the bond market,"" the executive said. ""Interest rates are not coming down and I would not bet a lot that they will drop sharply."" He added, ""I personally think interest rates may decline by 50 basis points at the most this year."" Zuckerman said the 405 mln dlr bond sale was composed of 139 separate issues. ""Sixty pct were utilities, 20 pct were issued by foreign governments or corporations, and 20 pct were financial institutions,"" he detailed. The Chrysler treasurer said that the corporate paper had typically an 18-year maturity. ""The securities were long-term, high-quality bonds, mostly rated AA-minus or A-plus,"" he said. Zuckerman said Chrysler sold the corporate bonds at about 1.6 pct above yesterday's closing prices for these issues. ""That showed our portfolio is desirable,"" he commented. Corporate bond traders noted that Chrysler's sale occurred against the backdrop of a slightly weak secondary market. They said they believed that Chrysler was sold the corporates at a large profit because the issues were bought by the automaker for its portfolio when interest rates were much higher. Chrysler's Zuckerman said his company sold the corporate issues to four large Wall Street securities firms. He said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers Inc bought most of the bonds. However, Zuckerman declined to name the other two houses. Yesterday, Chrysler presented four investment bankers with a list of bonds and asked them to submit bids by this morning. Zuckerman said that Morgan Stanley bought more corporate bonds than any one of the other three houses. Wall Street sources said they believed First Boston Corp and Merrill Lynch Capital Markets were also in on the bidding for the corporate bonds.

Pickens was not available for comment. Traders noted that activity in the stock increased today after a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco. Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4. Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised at market rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeover attempt. ""It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and his group may be interested,"" Feretti said. ""But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of its sheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes a challenge."" Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take over Dallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp DIA> last winter, has made no secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gas reserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize sooner than oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimated in excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said. Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at 58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow of about 10 dlrs a share ""which is probably very attractive to Pickens."" Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup value well into the 60 dlr a share range. ""I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostile takeover,"" Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analyst John Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors. ""Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrs in long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding."" He said the buyer would also have to deal with ""the intractable problems"" Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energy businesses. Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number of defensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such as spin off some of its non-energy businesses directly to shareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnership out of its natural gas pipeline interests. An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouraged the Pickens rumor. ""Pickens has a plateful already with his holdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess,"" he said. ""I don't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problems with Case (the farm equipment unit), which has been losing about 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billion dlrs on the market today.""

With troops in place in Brazil's ports and oil installations, the government of Prersident Jose Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of force. Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and six areas of oil production. The state-oil company Petrobras requested the intervention because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry employees. The government had already dispatched more than 1,000 marines to occupy the country's main ports after a national seamen's strike was ruled illegal last Friday. The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day, represents a stern challenge to the government. The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil desperately needs foreign exchange. It was a deterioration in the country's trade balance which precipitated Brazil's current debt crisis and the decision on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen's strike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the most important in South America -- and the country's other main ports. Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on the quays near the strike-bound ships, but the military presence here is generally discreet. A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are out of sight. Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, the Docemarte, seamen's leaders said. After explaining to the captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because the strike was illegal, the men returned to work. One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said ""it is a psychological war. They are using force and we are using peaceful methods."" Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, the Docemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working. At the seamen's national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are strike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports. Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, seamen in Santos said the strikers on board ships here were not running out of food. The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney's civilian government since it came to power two years ago. Yesterday, in a separate protest, hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank interest rates. The current rash of labour unrest in industry and agriculture stems from the failure of the government's now-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze. Reuter "

Acting Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Charles Rule defended the administration's record on antitrust enforcement and told the panel at today's hearing that the department was in the process of preparing a response to Metzenbaum's request. ""We have nothing to hide, but we have to be concerned about our institutional interests,"" Rule said. He provided no explanation of what those interests were. Metzenbaum said he had scheduled the hearings and requested the data out of concern ""that this administration has abandoned the nation's historical commitment to effective antitrust enforcement."" ""The green light is on,"" he said. ""Merger mania is rampant in this country...and it is not serving us well."" Rule countered that the low inflation and interest rates and the continuing economic expansion meant the administration's policies were working well. He said simply looking at the number of challenges filed against pending mergers was misleading because there was no reason to believe that a fixed proportion of all mergers were anticompetitive. ""If you look at the individual cases rather than the statistics, you will see that we are appropriately enforcing the antitrust laws,"" Rule said. Metzenbaum's view, however, was bolstered by the National Association of Attorneys General, a group of top state law enforcement officials. ""The federal assault on antitrust has been comprehensive,"" Robert Abrams, attorney general of New York and chairman of the group's antitrust committee, told the panel. ""The reduction in enforcement has been exacerbated by federal attempts to prevent both state attorneys general and private parties from enforcing the law in accordance with its clear meaning and Supreme Court interpretations,"" Abrams said. The group has drafted its own merger guidelines to bring uniformity to the attorney generals' efforts to enforce the laws at the state level. Reuter "

An officer on Daiwa's corporate syndicate desk said he believed this was Rockwell's first debt offering since 1984, when the company tapped the Euromarkets. Daiwa, the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd of Japan, has become the first foreign bookrunner in the U.S. corporate debt market this year. The firm is sustaining a trend that first emerged in early 1986, investment bankers said. Daiwa headed a syndicate that won the Rockwell notes in competitive bidding. Rockwell has a net interest charge of 7.722 pct for the issue, the Daiwa officer said. The Japanese firm bid the notes at 98.473 and set a coupon of 7-1/2 pct and reoffering price of 98.75 to yield 46 basis points more than comparable Treasury securities. Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the 46 basis point spread over Treasuries was aggressive. They said a premium of 50 basis points or more would have been more appropriate. ""It looks like Daiwa submitted a kamikaze bid just to get the business,"" said one competitor. However, the Daiwa officer defended his firm's pricing of the deal. ""Because Rockwell has not floated debt since 1984, the company's note issue is a museum piece,"" he said. The officer said he believed the Rockwell paper would sell quickly, mostly because the company is well known and has not tapped the debt market in three years. ""Investors are hungry for high-grade debt issued by household names,"" agreed one corporate bond trader. Non-callable for seven years, the issue is rated Aa-2 by Moody's and AA by Standard and Poor's.

South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt. He said in an interview with Reuters that after a few years it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position. He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900 mln dlrs. Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once its foreign debt was substantially reduced, he said ""yes, I think so."" Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products valued at 1.8 billion dlrs. About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan. Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen. He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reduce his country's 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United States and also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan. Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy U.S. goods than Japanese goods. He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation. Rha said ""I hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions."" But he added ""the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions because of domestic political reasons."" Speaking of his own country, he said ""We have made a lot of concessions already."" He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in industrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activity and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by strengthening protection of copyrights and patents. Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs. Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said ""at this moment, we have no thought of retaliation.""

The delivery of about 8.0 mln dlrs worth of plywood, in addition to lumber, hinges on whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture will interpret plywood as an agricultural commodity under the credit guarantee program, he said.

""This is the first time we have been able to sell wood products in Iraq, he said. Without the USDA program it would not have been possible.

Wall Street market analysts said two changes in the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average were part of a shift away from smokestack industries that have long dominated the 30-stock index. ""It strengthens the Dow,"" said William LeFevre, analyst at Advest Inc. He said Coca-Cola Co KO>, one of the two additions, ""is a genuine consumer stock as opposed to a smokestack."" He applauded the decision to drop Inco Ltd N>, ""a super stock at one time that hasn't done much lately."" The editors of the Wall Street Journal also decided to add Boeing Co BA> and dropping Owens-Illinois Inc OI>. Charles Jensen of MKI Securities said Inco was a ""stodgy number."" But he noted that putting two new stocks in an average of 30 is a relatively minor change. ""This will distinctly make the index more useful,"" said Frank Korth of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ""The movement of the market to the upside will be enhanced by the shift to Coke."" But he said Shearson's aerospace analyst today removed Boeing from the firm's recommended list, taking it from a buy to a hold. Korth said Boeing's business appeared to be leaning too heavily to the military side as opposed to commercial. Prior to tomorrow's market opening the Wall Street Journal will publish a new divisor to be used in calculating the index. LeFevre said the divisor will probably go up a bit but will probably be lower than its current level of 0.889 later in the year due to forthcoming splits in components such as International Paper Co IP>. The divisor, which is adjusted whenver stocks are split, dropped below one for the first time in May of last year. The 0.889 divisor means that a change of 1/8 (12.5 cts) in the price of a component produces a change of about 14 cts in the index. Reuter "

Democrats on the House Budget Committee, meeting behind closed doors to draft the outlines of next year's federal budget, say their work is proceeding at a snail's pace. In a series of interviews, panel members conceded that the budget panel's drafting sessions, which began yesterday and were initially expected to end late tomorrow, will now extend into next week. ""We've a long ways to go,"" Rep. Martin Frost (D-Tex.). told Reuters. ""We are not making the progress that we should,"" said Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Calif.). Members also acknowledged that the panel's preliminary goal for spending cuts and new revenues would not be enough to enable the government to meet the 108 billion dlr deficit ceiling set for the coming year by federal law. Budget Commitee Chairman William Gray (D-Pa.), interviewed during a break in the lawmakers' secret deliberations, said the committee was still debating the shape of the overall budget and had come to no agreement on the size or precise form of the new revenues or spending cuts to be pursued. But the lawmakers said the House Democratic leadership has asked the panel to come up with a package of 36 billion dlrs in deficit-reducing measures. The package would include 18 billion dlrs in new revenues, nine billion dlrs in military spending cuts and nine billion dlrs in domestic spending reductions, they said. The Democratic lawmakers said they were still trying to meet those goals but had made no firm decisions. In particular, the legislators said they were having trouble coming up with the nine billion dlrs in military spending cuts. ""We're talking in the range of 15-20 billion dlrs in new revenues, but if we can't come up with the full amount of defense cuts, we would have to raise more in new revenues,"" Fazio said. The particular manner in which new revenues would be raised also has not been decided, the lawmakers said. House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas) has urged passage of a tax on securities transactions to bring an estimated 20 billion dlrs in new revenues into the U.S. Treasury. But the administration is totally opposed to such a tax, a top official told Reuters yesterday. The official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said the administration also opposed another suggestion by Wright that the administration delay next year's cut in the top tax rate, called for in the recent tax overhaul law. The Congressional Democrats first hinted about two weeks ago that they would seek to reduce the deficit by about 36 billion dlrs and put aside the question of whether the effort would meet the 108 billion dlr deficit target set for fiscal year 1988 by the new federal balanced budget law. The administration has predicted that approval of 42 billion dlrs in deficit reductions would meet the target. Its budget plan, submitted in January, called for 1.024 trillion dlrs in spending on revenues of 916 billion dlrs. But the Congressional Budget Office has said the administration forecast was based on overly optimistic assumptions about the economy. The nonpartisan office said the administration's budget plan, if adopted, would yield a deficit of 134 billion dlrs, missing the deficit target by 26 billion dlrs and. Reuter "

Enrollment in the U.S. Agriculture Department's fourth conservation signup is expected to be announced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may be higher than total enrollment for the first three signups. Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres, USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far in the 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres. Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into the program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a congressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will be accepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high. As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area is expected to attract the greatest enrollment. ""The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which we'll get signup in,"" a USDA conservation specialist said. Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the acreage pulled from that area, he said. Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production, but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small percent of the total. A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more interest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.

Heavy rains fell again in Argentina's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularly high volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe provinces. Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires, heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in La Pampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe. Rainfall was lighter in other provinces. Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to 31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mm in Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in Chaco. Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the rains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflower crops may have suffered. Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by the bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rains would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow farm machinery to operate. The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern Buenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas there since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm. Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares, Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after flying over the flooded area. Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000 hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that 200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are low-lying and flood easily. Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of the damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants. The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between 15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct a week ago. Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were revised downward in light of the bad weather. Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down 34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mln tonnes. Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15 pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week ago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2 mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a week ago. Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes, according to official figures. Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mln tonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures. Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching between four and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to four pct a week ago. Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest. Reuter "

An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker International Corp based on revised terms that allow the companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as required by the U.S. Justice Department. Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold. An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a funding limit. The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2 billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed Justice Department consent decree that would have given the companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed business. Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the merger. Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous agreement had proposed a three-month period. Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month extension to complete the sale. He said there were ""several people looking"" at the domestic drilling bit business. The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore. Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects ""substantial cutbacks"" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc, the name the merged company will take. Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies should put the company on a profitable course. ""We think that in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see something close to breakeven,"" he said. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs. Baker, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost 34.2 mln dlrs on revenues of 297.7 mln dlrs. Reuter "

[u'usa']|"PLAN TO CUT DELAYS ADVANCES AT SEVEN AIRPORTS

The Department of Transportation (DOT) said it would go ahead at seven airports with a controversial plan to reduce airline delays by enabling competing companies to coordinate their schedules. Under the plan, the DOT will grant the airlines immunity from the antitrust laws so they can redistribute their flight times over the day and avoid the clustering of flights that typically occurs at the most desirable travel times. Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole said she had decided to grant unconditional immunity to the carriers serving Atlanta's Hartsfield and Chicago's O'Hare airports. At five other airports--Dallas-Fort Worth, Boston, Denver, Newark and Philadelphia--Dole said she would grant conditional immunity to enable further government study. Under this part of the plan, the carriers serving these five airports have been asked to give DOT their summer 1987 schedules by the end of the week. The agency will then review the schedules and decide by Monday whether they threaten to cause delays. If so, those airports would be added to the list of those granted wider immunity to enable scheduling talks. Dole said she was confident no anticompetitive effects would result from the talks, which she said would be monitored by U.S. officials and would be open to the public. Flight delays at the nation's 22 busiest airports soared in 1986 to 367,000 from 295,000 in 1985. The government believes most delays are caused by weather. The DOT first proposed the immunity plan in late January and said it might be granted for a total of 13 airports.

Inco closed 1-3/8 lower at 19-3/8 in second most active trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Wall Street Journal, which selects the index, said Inco was dropped to make the index more representative of the market. Inco, the non-Communist world's largest nickel producer, was a member of the index since 1928. Replacing Inco and Owens-Illinois Inc will be Coca-Cola Co and Boeing Co, effective tomorrow. Nickel analyst Ilmar Martens at Walwyn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said Inco's removal from the index would likely spark short-term selling pressure on the stock. ""Some investors who have Inco may suddenly say, 'well, because it's not now a Dow stock, we should eliminate that investment,'"" said Martens, although he added the move was unlikely to have a serious long-term impact on Inco stock.

[u'usa']|"DOCTORS FIND LINK BETWEEN AIDS, SMALLPOX VIRUS

In a discovery that could complicate the search for an AIDS vaccine, a team of U.S. Army doctors said they have uncovered a potentially-fatal interaction between the AIDS virus and a virus used to protect against smallpox. Physicians at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research said a 19-year-old man, who apparently had been exposed to the AIDS virus, developed a pox-like disease and died after receiving the smallpox vaccine. The military now tests recruits for AIDS before vaccinating them. The findings, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine, are significant because scientists have begun working on an AIDS vaccine that relies on the smallpox vaccine. ""Our case report raises provocative questions concerning the ultimate safety of such vaccines,"" said the group led by Dr. Robert Redfield. The report also throws into question the belief held by some scientists that the smallpox vaccine, which exposes people to a milder, protective form of the disease known as cowpox, could be further modified to protect people against a host of other diseases.

[u'usa']|"BIRTH CONTROL PILLS HELP PREVENT CANCER - STUDY

Doctors at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said they have new evidence that birth control pills can help provide long-term protection from cancer of the ovary, even if the pills are only taken for a few months. The study, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, also found that all the various types of oral contraceptives on the market were equally effective in lowering the rate of ovarian cancer. The researchers estimated that the use of birth control pills in this country probably prevented about 1,700 cases of ovarian cancer in 1982. As more and more women who have taken oral contraceptives ""move into the age groups that are at highest risk for epithelial ovarian cancer we may witness a declining incidence of this serious disease,"" they said. Specifically, the team led by Dr. Howard Ory found that ""oral contraceptive use, even for a few months, reduces the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer by 40 percent for women 20 to 54 years of age. ""The effect probably takes from five to ten years to become apparent, but it persists long after the use of oral contraceptives ends. Moreover, protection exists regardless of the formulation of oral contraceptive used,"" they said. Reuter "

U.S. economic data this week could be the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said. Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be positive for the market, the analysts said. ""You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds right now,"" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane. Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest to break below chart support in the June contract failed to materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early quickly covered short positions, they said. ""Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in as expected it won't be that bad for the market,"" Sloane said. Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct. Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up 0.8 to 1.2 pct. Industrial production and the producer price index Friday both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she added. Retail sales ""will tell us whether or not we will be able to fill the gap,"" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds closed at 100-4/32 today. Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer. ""A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the market approached the top of the range,"" Singer said. In order for bonds to break above the top of the range, which is just below 102 in the June contract, ""the crude oil rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,"" Singer said. ""Fed funds are already easing back down toward the six pct level."" The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said. Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to ease to 99-6/32 and find support. ""I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet. The jury is still out this week,"" Rozich said.

In a novel type of financing, Texas Instruments Inc marketed a three-part, 225 mln dlr issue of convertible money market preferred stock through Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc as sole manager. Shearson, which originated the new convertible concept, said each of the three tranches totaled 75 mln dlrs. In the first, a 2.85 pct dividend was set on the stock with a strike price of 190 dlrs that represented a 15 pct premium over the common stock price when terms were set. Also included were 4.36 pct dividend preferred with a 220 dlr strike price and 33 pct premium and 4.49 pct dividend preferred with a 235 dlr strike price and 42 pct premium. Texas Instruments common closed at 167.25 dlrs, up 2-1/8. Ronald Gallatin, managing director at Shearson, said that ""demand for the offering was unbelievable, especially for the first tranche."" He said that Shearson originated the concept of auction money market preferred stock three years ago. The conversion feature of this issue is the new wrinkle. Commenting on the first tranche, Gallatin noted that the original pricing talk called for a dividend in the four to 4.20 pct area. This was gradually cut to 2.85 pct because of intense demand, saving the issuer money in financing costs. The Shearson official said that virtually all buyers of the first tranche received less than they wanted. He said the latter two tranches were less strongly oversubscribed. Like non-convertible money market preferred stock, the new version allows investors to redeem their holdings every seven weeks. Investors then can maintain their holdings, sell them, or offer to hold on to the securities if the auction dividend is at least at a level they specify in advance. Gallatin said the securities were sold to a broad range of investors, including major insurance companies, banks, money managers and pension funds. Reuter "

USX Corp said proved reserves of oil and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at year-end 1985. The figures, in USX's just-released 1986 annual report, indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7 mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations. USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp, had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil and gas operations. About 24 pct of total sales came from USX's USS steel unit and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate. According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa, where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln, reflecting the exclusion of Libya. Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985. Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic feet, excluding Libyan reserves. U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion from 1.53 trillion. In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962 mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited figure the company reported on Jan 27. USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter. In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03 billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge included the ""indefinite idling"" last month of four plants in Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas. Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled. ""These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved market conditions for the products from these plants may make it feasible to reopen some of them,"" USX said in the report.

[u'usa']|"PHILLIPSP> SAYS STOCK UP ON STEPS TO PARE DEBT

Phillips Petroleum Co Chairman C. J. ""Pete"" Silas said his company's stock, ranked fourth on the most active list of stocks traded today, rose partly because of steps it took to pare its debt. Silas told Reuters in an interview today, ""part of this strength results from the rise in oil prices and also because some of the analysts have been happy with the steps we've taken in 1986 to pare our debt."" Phillips stocks rose 1/4 to 14 dlrs a share following recommendations by some oil analysts, a company source said. Phillips debt stood at 5.9 billion dlrs in December 1986 down from a 1985 high of 8.6 billion dlrs, analysts said. ""At 14 dlrs a share, Phillips is priced closer to the actual price of oil,"" he added. Silas said, ""if the analysts are right that oil prices will rise to 20 dlrs or higher, then it seems to make sense to buy Phillips."" He is, however, more cautious about the strength in crude prices, expecting the price to fluctuate between 16-18 dlrs a barrel for the year. Oil industry analysts said one reason for the stock's popularity of the stock is that it traded at a strong discount to its appraised value and was attractively priced for small investors. Charles Andrew, an analyst who follows Phillips for John S. Herold Inc of Greenwich, Conn said that the appraised value of the company, based on available data is 34.25 dlrs. ""The stock is trading at about 1/3 its appraised value. The company has tremendous leverage and if it can get its act together and if oil prices are steady to higher there is good room for improvement,"" he said. But, he added, ""if oil prices turn lower, there will be a lot of pressure on Phillips."" Phillips' shares fell as low as eight dlrs a share over the last 52 weeks with a 1987 low of 11-3/4 dlrs in 1987. Analysts say that the appraised value of the company could be revised due to asset sales of their oil and gas reserves. Silas told Reuters that the asset sales which amount to about two billion dlrs for 1986 were completed and that none were planned. Reuter "

House trade lawmakers took their first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on controversial plans to protect American industries. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United States. The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs. Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific trade penalties. The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking his party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods. This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances. ""My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the trade deficit down,"" he told reporters. The trade law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more competitive. House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill. ""I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective bill,"" he told reporters. The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and to improve education and worker training. The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S. industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining, safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the country's economic development.

Soviet first deputy prime minister Vsevolod Murakhovsky said at the end of a brief visit here his country wanted to boost joint business with France, but that a reduction of France's trade deficit with the Soviet Union depended on the French. Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State Agro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French companies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec. Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable juice processing with Imec. An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other details. The other two companies were not immediately available for comment. Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France's trade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky told Reuters: ""It all depends on France."" At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986. Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with anybody with ""interesting"" proposals offering latest technology and assuring ""a mutual advantage."" He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting. He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws guaranteeing ""the interests of foreign partners"" in joint ventures. But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the new joint venture laws. He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng. He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposals for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of goods. Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union's food production capacity. Reuter "

[u'ecuador']|"ECUADOR SEEKS HALT TO PAYMENTS TO BANKS IN 1987

Ecuador, stricken by a severe earthquake, is seeking through negotiations with private foreign banks to postpone all payments due to them for the rest of the year, Finance Minister Domingo Cordovez said. He said in a statement, ""The idea with the foreign banks is to obtain from them the best terms to give the Ecuadorean economy a complete relief in the period of deferral of payments on the foreign debt during the present year."" The statement referred only to payments due to private foreign banks, a senior government finance official told Reuters. These creditors hold two-thirds of Ecuador's foreign debt which totals 8.16 billion dlrs. It did not refer to debts maturing to foreign governments and multilateral lending agencies, accounting for the remainder of Ecuador's foreign debt, the official said. He said Ecuador owed the private foreign banks between 450 and 500 mln dlrs in interest payments for the rest of 1987 and about 66 mln in principal payments maturing this year. Cordovez said Ecuador would seek new loans from multilateral organisations. A World Bank mission was due here soon to evaluate emergency loans, government officials said. Ecuador has also appealed for emergency aid from about 40 foreign governments. Government officials have calculated losses to the 1987 budget from last Thursday's earthquake at 926 mln dlrs. In 1986, Ecuador's total service on the foreign debt was about 996 mln dlrs to all creditors. The quake ruptured Ecuador's main oil pipeline, suspending crude exports for five months until the line is repaired. Oil accounts for up to two-thirds of its total exports and up to 60 pct of total revenues. Before the tremor, Ecuador suspended interest payments on January 31 to private foreign banks. Officials said they stopped interest payments due to a cash-flow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices, which cut 1986 exports by about 25 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs. Ecuadorean finance officials have been in telephone contact every day this week with some of the banks who sit on its 14-bank advisory committee, the senior government finance official said. The committee represents the country's 400 or so private foreign bank creditors. Cordovez also said in the statement, ""The banks should perceive that it is impossible at this moment to comply with what was forseen."" Cordovez added, Ecuador must make a new proposal in line with the reality since the earthquake by seeking better options of deferment and of softening the negotiation conditions."" Interest payments fall due at least monthly to private foreign banks. Ecuador's initial proposal earlier this year was to make only one semi-annual or one annual interest payment this year. Under this proposal, it sought to defer interest payments until June at the earliest, foreign bankers and government officials here said. Ecuadorean officials held their last formal meeting with the advisory committee in New York in January, but the negotiations were suspended on January 16 due to the 12-hour kidnapping of President Leon Febres Cordero by air force paratroopers.

International efforts to redirect Japan's export-driven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy going if the country's largest defence contractor and world's biggest shipbuilder is anything to go by. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd MITH.T> (MHI), which began making ships and iron goods for Japan's military rulers 130 years ago, is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its efforts to maintain its share of export markets. ""If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products, everyone will buy them,"" MHI president Yotaro Iida said. Although two of MHI's main businesses, shipbuilding and power plant construction, have been hit hard by the yen's 40 pct rise against the dollar, the company has no plans to abandon them, Iida told Reuters in an interview. Its other big activity, aircraft component manufacture, has performed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money Tokyo spends on defence procurement each year. ""We have made the utmost efforts among the world's manufacturers to improve productivity,"" he said. ""You may be surprised if you come to see our plants. The outside is old but the inside is ultra-modern, with robots and computers."" Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that MHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors. The company has slashed its workforce to 47,000 from 86,000 in 1976. Despite its cost-cutting, MHI expects profits to drop 40 pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March 31, from 1985/86's record 50.14 billion. And that includes gains from the sale of MHI's stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp MIMT.T> for 49 billion yen. Iida is optimistic about the future, however. He said a resurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent recovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power plants in developing countries will help MHI restore its exports-to-sales ratio to the past decade's average of 30 pct. MHI's exports-to-sales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in the half-year ended last September, from 35 to 36 pct five years ago. China is the most promising market, although MHI also considers other non-oil-producing developing countries as major customers. ""Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a lack of foreign currency,"" Iida said. But he added that he felt MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government financial support. It can also finance the plants itself and recover its investment through product sales, a strategy Iida said could prove popular in the future. In shipping, MHI is fighting back against low-priced South Korean competition by building more technologically advanced carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products difficult to transport. Shipbuilders Association officials told Reuters MHI is the world's largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity. Domestically, MHI is involved in 12 national projects, including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch vehicles for man-made satellites. It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence Agency's F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles, although all of these have been built under licence from U.S. Firms. MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to develop the country's own fighter plane to replace the currently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s. Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure on Tokyo to buy a U.S. Plane, either the McDonnell Douglas Corp F-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16, to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the U.S. ""It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with U.S. Makers as Japan is supported by the U.S. Defence umbrella,"" Iida said. MHI also plans to cooperate with the U.S. In its Strategic Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in the project when it moves from the research stage, he said. The U.S. Has been seeking Japan's technological support. In fiscal 1985/86, aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of MHI's sales, shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct. Iida said the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct, aircraft and special vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct. As for the remaining 30 pct, Iida said he wanted to shift the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to manufacturers and towards household goods, but he declined to specify which products.

More than three quarters of the total, some 290,000 tonnes, will come from the United States. That will be a 93.7 pct increase on 1986 when U.S. Imports totalled 150,000 tonnes, an official said. He said the U.S. Increase is due partly to the competitiveness of American cotton and partly to efforts by Seoul to reduce its trade surplus with Washington. South Korea is the second largest importer of U.S. Cotton after Japan. REUTER "

The Australian Wheat Board's (AWB) 1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes already sold, AWB general manager Ron Paice said. ""We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export target for the year,"" he said in a statement. He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the Soviet Union and Iraq. In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes. Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered to the AWB. The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said. However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said. Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's February Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes. But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes. The official estimate is not yet available. In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of the 16.13 mln tonne crop. Another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000 sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB's receival system, according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics data.

The Tokyo Stock Exchange said in a statement it is considering reducing brokerage fees on yen convertible bonds.

Under the current system, investors must also pay 0.6 pct of face value as brokerage fee to securities houses for transactions involving principal over 30 mln yen.

The overseas production in yen terms of Japanese firms should rise 26 pct in 1987/88 ending March after a four pct fall in 1986/87, a Ministry of International Trade and Industry survey said. It attributed the rise to companies moving production overseas to avoid losses due to the strong yen. The survey covered 122 major firms in 17 sectors. The survey called for bold moves to stimulate domestic demand to achieve the government's goal of 3.5 pct gross national product growth in 1987/88. A package of economic measures to boost the economy is expected next month.

[u'ship', u'brazil']|"STRIKING BRAZIL SEAMEN THREATEN MASS RESIGNATION

Striking seamen said they would offer their collective resignation rather than end their 13-day-old national strike on management's terms. The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday night. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work under duress. President Jose Sarney's government despatched troops to Brazil's ports and oil installations on Tuesday. Seamen in Santos, Brazil's main port, are in defiant mood. One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, told Reuters that most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations on Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the country's main ports. The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get, and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm the strike is doing to exports. An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners Association read, ""The seamen's strike is illegal, irrational and unpatriotic."" The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the union's office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977 cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month. At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with allowances. ""Brazil's seamen are the second worst paid in the world, after Ghana's,"" dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have doubled since then with the collapse of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze. Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the dispute. The seamen are demanding pay raises of about 200 pct but have been offered less than half that. REUTER "

[u'earn', u'saudi-arabia']|"SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD

Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks are reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non- performing loans. Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year. But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable. One senior bank credit officer said ""The work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions, but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money."" The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in 1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad decline. The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks had sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world oil prices tumbled. Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate on the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at the expense of increased provisions. The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, United Saudi Commercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln riyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln. Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to 60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985. Other results released so far show Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7 mln riyals, while Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals. Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's CCI.N> Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez, increased provisions sharply. Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1 mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln riyals. Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non- performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the Saudi economy bottoms out. Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity, but one banker said ""The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions."" From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank National Commercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector, bankers calculated. Between 1982 and 1985, Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as the second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine. Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non-performing. Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres. Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank as the strongest earners. Other banks such as Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by the British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base. Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions. Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a Saudi bank go under and not only supported Saudi Cairo Bank> after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB. The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans. And while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending, conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products. One banker said ""Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not good."" Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return on their money. In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer funds are held on current account. REUTER "

Indonesian coffee exporters are preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of export quotas, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters. Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia, the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas. ""But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we can never bridge the gap,"" Dharyono said. Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries, along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee Organistion (ICO) talks in London. Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal. AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise. Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia, the world's second largest producer, but gave no details. ""Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market stays like it is,"" Muda said. He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1. Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S. And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia's case more firmly. He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations. Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed ""realistic criteria."" The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends. Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied. Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop. Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both refusing to alter their positions. Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices. Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said. Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30, is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level of 360,000 tonnes, he said. He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for the time of year. REUTER "

New Zealand's budget deficit in the 10 months to January widened to 4.37 billion N.Z. Dlrs from 3.41 billion in the 10 months to January 1986, government figures show. Revenue rose to 12.92 billion dlrs from 10.82 billion, while spending climbed to 17.28 billion from 14.24 billion. Taking into account expenditure on major energy project debt totalling 2.28 billion, as against nothing in the earlier period, total net expenditure was 19.57 billion dlrs. Finance Minister Roger Douglas said in a statement the deficit was on course for the year-end forecast. Douglas said, ""Net expenditure to this point in the year was about as we would have expected it to be, while revenue was slightly ahead of forecast."" He said, ""Revenue before provisional tax flows is looking encouraging at this stage in the year.""

Taiwan's new controls on currency inflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a flood of speculative money prompted by the local currency surge against the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said. The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding one mln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance and bank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source. Petitioners have to show their remittances relate to genuine commercial transactions. Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report all outward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight, insurance and royalties, to the central bank. But bankers said they believed the new controls would be ineffective since businessmen could split up remittances into smaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan's flourishing currency black market. The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are a panic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over the past week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to slow the growth of Taiwan's exports to the U.S. The government has denied local press reports Washington is pressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs. The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70. ""I don't think the central bank has a final target,"" said an executive with a U.S. Bank. Other bankers and economists said they are wary of making any firm predictions about how far the Taiwan dollar will rise. Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985. The surplus widened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billion dlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year. Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative money flowed into Taiwan in 1986. This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more than 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last year and provided further upward pressure on the currency. The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against the U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouraging speculators. Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last week Washington's pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves meant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable. Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the currency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow the local dollar to find its own level. ""Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but the central bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not want to take the risk,"" said one local banker. He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary measure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with the exchange rate problem. The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt around the real issue, he said. Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign exchange controls, said an executive with a western bank. ""The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bank charges will not outweigh the profits of speculation,"" said the manager of a European bank. Economists criticised the controls, saying they could antagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economic liberalisation in Taiwan. ""Instead of liberalising outflows, the government has restricted inflows,"" said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickers da Costa. A local banker, who declined to be named, said, ""It's basically ridiculous. It's a backward movement and goes against the government's liberalisation programme."" Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to enable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow individuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the country each year.

Australia expects meat and livestock exports to the Middle East to maintain an upward trend this year, managing director of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corp, Peter Frawley, said. He told Reuters an improvement in the economic climate and less competition from the European Community should lead in the Gulf area to higher beef sales, which dropped from 33,000 tonnes in 1980 to just 2,300 tonnes last year. ""In the last three to four months there has been a resurgence of inquiries,"" he said. Frawley is on a Gulf tour which will also take him to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to assess market potential. On beef exports, he said a 50 pct drop in European Community intervention stock in the past 12 months would help Australian sales. The fall meant the EC was not as aggressive in these markets, where the Australian trade was the natural source of supply, and Australia was ""now back in,"" Frawley said. He said there was a debate in Australia as to whether the Middle East market for livestock, which accounts for two-thirds of meat export value to the area, would be maintained. He believed the trade would remain with a continuing demand for fresh meat. The number of live sheep shipped last year to Saudi Arabia, the biggest single market, was 3,214,159 compared with 2,939,226 in 1985. The numbers shipped to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain fell, however. Frawley said the slackening in demand in the Gulf had been offset by other Arab countries around the Mediterranean. Other than livestock, Australia's overall meat sales to the Middle East rose to 72,374 tonnes in 1986 from 52,403 tonnes the previous year, largely due to the sale of 25,790 tonnes of mutton and lamb to Iran. Australia sold 9,824 tonnes to Iran in 1985 after being virtually excluded by New Zealand competition for several years. Frawley said the 1986 sale contract had included a barter provision, but Iran had paid in full in cash. Negotiations with the Iranians for 1987 shipments were currently under way, with Iran again seeking credit and barter provisions, he said. Frawley said there had been a tremendous growth in demand for chilled lamb in the last four to five years and he predicted this would continue. ""The Middle East, and the Gulf in particular, is now Australia's largest market for lamb, chilled and flown in. Australia is in an ideal position to provide the supplies if the market is willing to pay a premium for a fresh, young product,"" he said. REUTER "

Diplomats said this reflected Hungary's policy of keeping the sugar beet area stable under the current five-year plan (1985-89) and producing enough to cover only domestic demand despite the recent rise of world prices to 10 month highs. Drought cut the 1986 harvest to 3.58 mln tonnes from 4.07 mln in 1985. But a record yield of 130 kilos per tonne of beet kept production at 454,000 tonnes, with 30,000 extra refined in Yugoslavia from Hungarian beet. Output was 483,000 in 1985. REUTER "

The tin price is likely to rise to 20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers' accord on export quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell the metal at lower prices, a Malaysian government bulletin said. The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers' interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to 90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes overhang. It said consumption by industrialised countries should stay at 160,000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditors and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively unless there is a large and abrupt price jump. The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help push up the price of tin, the bulletin said. A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the ringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tin cheaper in sterling terms, it added. ""Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin market, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo,"" the bulletin said. REUTER "

[u'ecuador']|"ECUADOR SEEKS HALT TO PAYMENTS TO BANKS IN 1987

Ecuador, stricken by a severe earthquake, is seeking through negotiations with private foreign banks to postpone all payments due to them for the rest of the year, Finance Minister Domingo Cordovez said. He said in a statement, ""The idea with the foreign banks is to obtain from them the best terms to give the Ecuadorean economy a complete relief in the period of deferral of payments on the foreign debt during the present year."" The statement referred only to payments due to private foreign banks, a senior government finance official told Reuters. These creditors hold two-thirds of Ecuador's foreign debt which totals 8.16 billion dlrs. It did not refer to debts maturing to foreign governments and multilateral lending agencies, accounting for the remainder of Ecuador's foreign debt, the official said. He said Ecuador owed the private foreign banks between 450 and 500 mln dlrs in interest payments for the rest of 1987 and about 66 mln in principal payments maturing this year. Cordovez said Ecuador would seek new loans from multilateral organisations. A World Bank mission was due here soon to evaluate emergency loans, government officials said. Ecuador has also appealed for emergency aid from about 40 foreign governments. Government officials have calculated losses to the 1987 budget from last Thursday's earthquake at 926 mln dlrs. In 1986, Ecuador's total service on the foreign debt was about 996 mln dlrs to all creditors. The quake ruptured Ecuador's main oil pipeline, suspending crude exports for five months until the line is repaired. Oil accounts for up to two-thirds of its total exports and up to 60 pct of total revenues. Before the tremor, Ecuador suspended interest payments on January 31 to private foreign banks. Officials said they stopped interest payments due to a cash-flow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices, which cut 1986 exports by about 25 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs. Ecuadorean finance officials have been in telephone contact every day this week with some of the banks who sit on its 14-bank advisory committee, the senior government finance official said. The committee represents the country's 400 or so private foreign bank creditors. Cordovez also said in the statement, ""The banks should perceive that it is impossible at this moment to comply with what was forseen."" Cordovez added, Ecuador must make a new proposal in line with the reality since the earthquake by seeking better options of deferment and of softening the negotiation conditions."" Interest payments fall due at least monthly to private foreign banks. Ecuador's initial proposal earlier this year was to make only one semi-annual or one annual interest payment this year. Under this proposal, it sought to defer interest payments until June at the earliest, foreign bankers and government officials here said. Ecuadorean officials held their last formal meeting with the advisory committee in New York in January, but the negotiations were suspended on January 16 due to the 12-hour kidnapping of President Leon Febres Cordero by air force paratroopers. The Red Cross says that least 300 people died and at least 4,000 are missing due to the earthquake. REUTER "

The Bank of England does not favour the introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said. Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual dinner. Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in. ""Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators, for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all, the proprietors of the company,"" Leigh-Pemberton said. He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more efficient market penetration. ""The degree of success or failure (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested,"" he said. Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past. ""The aim is to pressurise a company's management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly or even primarily at the expense of the future,"" he said. Such bids ""often depend for their success on creating a highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market, and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,"" he said. In a clear reference recent events, he said ""those in the City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest, be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result.""

Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.

[u'france', u'pse']|"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - PARIS BOURSE REFORM

French stockbrokers will lose their jealously guarded 180-year-old monopoly of share trading over the next five years under reforms announced on Tuesday by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur. But with the prospect of fresh money flooding into their seriously under-capitalised share trading business, there were few signs of regret over the gradual passing of an era. ""It is a question of survival after London's Big Bang,"" said private market analyst Edouard Cointreau. Balladur said the long-expected reform of the Bourse structure will progressively allow domestic and foreign banks to buy stakes in stockbrokers' capital, while at the same time brokers will be allowed access to the money markets. The project foresees free access to the Bourse by January 1, 1992, the date set for the opening of a unified European financial market. The planned reform, expected to be put before Parliament before the end of the Spring session, will open up the capital of the 45 Paris and 15 regional stockbroker houses in three stages beginning on January 1 next year. The aim of the move, following the examples of Tokyo and London in opening up their tightly-controlled membership, was ""to take up the challenge of European financial integration and fierce international competition,"" Balladur announced. Cointreau, founder and chairman of the private market analysis company Centre d'Observation et de Prospective Sociales (COPS), said the reform was a natural development. ""The Paris market is rising but that cannot go on for ever. The brokers know it's a good time to sell part of their business,"" he told Reuters. The reform was inevitable given the European Community directive, said Ben Williams of Paris brokerage house Fauchier-Magnan. ""From a French point of view one cannot be very disappointed,"" he said, ""but some brokers must be a bit worried as it is not entirely evident that all brokerage houses are worth a lot of money."" He said that with the expansion of the market generally here quality brokerage staff would do very well out of the reforms in salary terms. ""But on the whole expertise is not very deep and the banks already have a lot of such expertise."" Dealers agreed generally that by allowing brokers to reinforce their equity capital, the reform was expected to improve their ability to take large positions in stocks and bolster the liquidity of the Paris market. The French Banking Association, grouping domestic and foreign banks operating here, welcomed the reforms. French banks, which only won direct access to the bond markets last September, have never been happy with the stockbrokers' continuing monopoly on share trading. Brokers said it was too soon to say what form links with other foreign brokerage houses and banks might take. ""Nobody is willing to talk about this yet but one can be sure that alliances have been formed over the past years,"" Williams said. Some brokers said the opening up of their capital to banks could pose questions such as whether the major banks might all aim for stakes in the most prestigious and best-performing brokerage houses, or whether the smaller houses might be targetted for swallowing up to give banks an easy entry onto the Bourse. Individual banks were reticent over likely strategy with their future partners. ""Discussions will get underway soon but no specific choice (of broker) has been made yet,"" a spokesman for Credit Lyonnais who declined to be named said. Balladur's project does not touch on dealing commissions but many dealers said the question had to be addressed since current bank commission was higher than that of brokers because banks, who cannot deal directly in shares, have to pay a fee to the broker they use for customer trading. According to a study by the Bourse official watchdog body COB in January, dealing fees on a transaction in shares for a gross total of 1,000 francs were 14.86 pct if the order was placed directly by a broker, against 20.79 pct for the same order passed through a bank. Xavier Dupont, Chairman of the Stockbrokers' Association, said the reform would not mean an end to the fixed scale of commissions. He said the overall reform would give the French financial markets a ""dynamic and efficient organisation."" But as both brokers and bankers commented, ""let's wait and see."" REUTER "

Jacobs Suchard AG JACZ.Z> hopes for another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986 net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said. The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs. Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the company's target of five pct real annual growth, had been made possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986 which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year. Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24 billion francs was due to currency factors. A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset by growth in operations and by structural changes within the group. Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany. Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25 pct against 25.3 pct. Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further increase in tax levels was expected in future. Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln the previous year. REUTER "

Deutsch-Suedamerikanische Bank AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dresdner Bank AG DRSD.F>, said it was not worried about Brazil stopping its interest payments. Board member Herbert Mittendorf told a news conference that Brazil's example was unlikely to be followed by other Latin American countries. He pointed out that the region's debt rose by only 2.8 pct last year to a total 396 billion dlrs. The countries' efforts to further economic growth and to consolidate budgets were ""not unsuccessful."" But the slump in oil prices and the decline in commodity prices hampered these efforts, he said. Latin American countries' exports fell last year by about 16 pct to 80 billion dlrs, with imports declining slightly to around 65 billion dlrs, Mittendorf said. The region's 1986 trade surplus was halved to an estimated 15 billion dlrs, he said. The cut in exchange earnings of oil exporting countries was only partly offset by the advantages gained by the region's oil importing states, he noted. The region's principal debtors are Brazil and Mexico, each owing about 100 billion dlrs at the end of last year, followed by Argentina with around 49 billion dlrs, Venezuela with 33 billion and Chile with 20 billion dlrs debt. Deutsch-Suedamerikanische Bank welcomed Mexico joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in mid 1986, which it saw as an effort to integrate the country to a larger extent into the world economy. However, realistic exchange rates were needed if the debtor countries were to compete in the world market, Mittendorf said. In this respect an easing of protectionist barriers was imperative, he said. The conversion of debt into equity was regarded as an important additional step towards debt consolidation. West German exports to Latin America declined by 4.1 pct in 1986 to 11 billion marks. Shipments to Mexico fell 19 pct to 1.9 billion marks and to Colombia by 15 pct to 600 mln marks, Mittendorf said. Exports to Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Central America were also lower last year than in 1985, while shipments to Brazil rose 11.5 pct to around two billion marks. Exports to Argentina went up by over three pct to 1.5 billion marks and those to Paraguay surged by 42 pct to 106 mln marks, he said.

Jacobs Suchard AG expects a world cocoa surplus of around 100,000 tonnes in 1987 compared with a 104,000 tonne surplus in 1986, Jens Sroka, head of commodity buying, told a news conference. The company expects prices to remain at around current levels despite the likelihood of agreement on buffer stock rules at the forthcoming London cocoa talks, and believes market intervention by the buffer stock manager would stabilise prices. Sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weak if any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement. Sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproduction will continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast a continued build-up in stocks. The recent failure of the London coffee talks had surprised market observers. Unless reason prevails and the major producers return to the conference table, the world coffee market will remain free and the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee for their foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic, Sroka added.

U.S. retail sales rose 4.77 billion dlrs, or 4.1 pct, in February to a seasonally adjusted 122.29 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said. The increase came after a revised 7.4 pct drop in January sales to a level of 117.52 billion dlrs. The department previously reported January retail sales fell 5.8 pct. Excluding autos, retail sales in February were up 1.5 pct after falling by a revised 0.4 pct in January.

But January sales dropped by 27.7 pct from December levels to 23.52 billion dlrs, more than the 22.4 pct fall originally reported.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, should increase speculative position limits on agricultural futures and do away with them for financial futures, Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, chairman Karsten Mahlmann said. Reporting to the CFTC Financial Products Advisory Committee on the conclusions so far of an ad hoc CBT committee on off-exchange trading issues, Mahlmann said, ""We came to the conclusion that no meaningful purpose is served by speculative position limits."" Position limits were supposed to prevent market manipulation, but ""I would submit that the Exchange and the CFTC currently have all the tools necessary to prevent market manipulation, whether an account is speculative or a hedge,"" the CBT chairman said. Malmann said the issue was of particular concern to the CBT because the exchange faced increasing competition from foreign markets, most of which did not have position limits. He said the ad hoc committee, which he also chairs, had agreed to propose that the definition of hedging be expanded to include risk management as well as risk reduction. Mahlmann said there was a danger that if a category of trading was given a name such as ""non-speculative hedging,"" insurance companies and pension funds might be held back from engaging in it by the regulatory bodies that govern such entities. The ad hoc committee proposed the establishment of ""prudence guidelines"" and a list of market activities that fell within those lines which might be lengthened in the future, he said.

The stock consolidation ""is something we're discussing, but it's not definite,"" Sand Technology president Jerry Shattner told Reuters in an interview. A private placement recently brought the number of outstanding shares to 106 mln, up from 97.1 mln shares on July 31, 1986, the fiscal yearend. ""The company has always had the aura of a penny stock,"" Shattner said, adding that Sand plans, at some time, to apply for listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange. Shattner said the company expects to report a profit of five pct, or about 350,000 dlrs, on sales of seven mln dlrs, for the second quarter ended January 31. Results for the third quarter should be about the same as the second, he added. Last year, Sand lost 243,064 dlrs on revenues of 7,012,195 dlrs in the second quarter. After ""a disastrous first quarter,"" Sand hopes to break even in the current fiscal year, Shattner said. The company has scaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs, from the 33.5 mln dlrs projected in December. The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. and Canadian dollars last year led to Sand's loss of 2.1 mln dlrs, or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs. In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost 1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585 dlrs. Shattner believes the company will post better results this year due to several factors. ""Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buying products in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachi in U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in the second quarter,"" he said.

[u'gnp', u'japan']|"JAPAN ECONOMY MAY BE NEAR BOTTOM, ECONOMISTS SAY

The worst may be just about over for Japan's battered economy but economists said they do not expect a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists polled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. ""The economy will bottom out in the middle of the year,"" said Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido. Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi agreed. ""It (the bottom) is in the offing,"" he said. But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct, from two pct in the current year, he said. Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst are increasing. The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward the end of last year. Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks, several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery. Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3 pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey released last week showed that the decline in Japanese corporate earnings may be nearing its end. And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said. Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels. The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market. ""The important thing is the exchange rate,"" Taketomi said. If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs of that yet, economists said. A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to recover, economists said. Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some loosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. The next reading of the economy's health should come early next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter, 1986. Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct. But a senior government official said the fourth quarter figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity. To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong. The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of 1986, the official said. Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also distorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second half of 1986. Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year bonuses, they said. As the government had to buy back some of the coins from retailers because they were unsold, the government's contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been boosted, economists said. Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last year was good. The senior government official said the fourth quarter performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than generally expected, while that of the external sector was better. REUTER "

[u'crude', u'japan', u'iran', u'opec']|"MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS

Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels, industry sources said. They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs. Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said. The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd. They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices. ""If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,"" one Japanese refiner said. ""We don't intend to put pressure on them,"" he added. Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower, oil traders said. They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices. Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus. The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the fixed prices. But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter. They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend. One Japanese refiner said, ""At the moment there's a lot of pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their ability."" Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, ""Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices."" He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels well below this time last year.

Directors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) adjourned a meeting late last night without reaching a decision on a petition to ban dual trading in Standard and Poor's 500 stock index futures, an exchange official said. CME president Bill Brodsky told Reuters that the CME board would meet again today and probably reach a decision either late today or tomorrow. Dual trading involves the right of members to trade for their own account as well filling orders for customers. The petition, signed by several hundred exchange members when it was circulated on the floor of the CME two weeks ago, calls for the elimination of dual trading in the S and P pit. Some industry watchers believe that if the CME eliminates the practice other exchanges will have to consider such a move. The practice has drawn criticism from some sectors in that it provides an opportunity for abusive practices in which customer orders are not executed at the best possible price. One practice, know as ""front-running,"" involves a broker trading ahead of a large customer order and then profiting by the impact on the market of the customer order. Reuter "

Phillips Petroleum Co will emphasize improving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt, C.J. ""Pete"" Silas, chairman, told Reuters in an interview. ""Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assets already installed,"" he said, but he declined to estimate annual cash flow for 1987. Analysts estimate Phillips"" cash flow at over one billion dlrs for 1987, while long term debt, which resulted from restructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985, hovers about 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986. Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raising the capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gas properties. ""We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cash flow prospects,"" he said. He projected a capital expenditure budget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mln dlrs. Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration and production, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silas said. ""Phillips' top priority in 1987 will be to get the waterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields to improve our ability to extract oil and increase earnings,"" Silas said. Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected to cost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln gross barrels of oil over a period of 24 years. Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silas said he was seeking ""a modification of terms with the Chinese government to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijang fields) commercially viable."" In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the Point Arguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter. ""We expect to start up the first platform then,"" Silas said. But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced the company to part with several oil and gas assets. Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K. North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in 1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that is now completed, Silas said. ""We sold high cost producing assets. They were not good value for us but possibly so for someone else,"" Silas said. Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earnings for the company. ""Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and we are using that to manage our debt. Even the asset sales, while regrettable, were necessary to reduce debt,"" Silas said. He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oil prices don't fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels for several months. ""Then, everyone would be looking at sales (of assets), and we're no different from the others,"" Silas said. In other areas, Silas looks for improved earnings from Phillips chemical operations, which provided 299 mln dlrs in earnings for 1986, up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985. ""This was our second best year pushed by a good supply and demand balance for products, low feedstocks and energy costs for our operations,"" Silas said, ""In 1987 we think the market's supply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstock and energy costs will rise due to price recovery.""

Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources said. They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average of 3.5 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's quota is 4.133 mln bpd. The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the world""s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the sources said. King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an average 18 dlrs. ""Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,"" he said. The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday, down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain artificially high levels by putting oil into storage. The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon, Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay official prices, the sources said. Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.

British Telecommunications Plc's BTY.L> profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old telephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said. Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results which were released earlier today, Odgers said the company faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems in Britain for three to five years. He said Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor. Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some of British Telecom's most profitable areas. One company official privately estimated that British Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct. The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, which lead to some disruption in service, could well have encouraged clients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said. However, he forecast that the last quarter's results overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout. He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at 50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities. But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength, economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth industry will help produce annual profit increases for the forseeable future. British Telecom will also seek to expand into manufacturing, he said, adding that research and development expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover. Analysts said the company's downbeat forecasts helped shares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday's close and off an early high of 248p. Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd said the market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a seven to eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profit over the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-tax profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion. Augar noted that a government-imposed formula linking charges to inflation meant that the company's scope for raising prices was limited as long as inflation remains low. Reuter "
[u'coffee', u'brazil', u'ico-coffee']|"NO NEAR TERM BRAZIL COFFEE MOVES EXPECTED

The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest, trade sources said. IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government ministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assess Brazil's position in the light of the failure of talks in London earlier this month to set new International Coffee Organization, ICO, export quotas. ""The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink its position completely,"" one Santos exporter said. A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for Thursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures. Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry. Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately. World prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year. The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of May and June export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set. With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world markets, they said. They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned increase in the quota, April registrations were opened and closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record amount for a single day. If May/June registrations are opened under similar conditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month. ""The problem would be how to limit sales,"" one exporter said. Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to maximise foreign exchange earnings. However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominant position as an exporter, but without causing a price war. General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO. The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were reintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks. With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added. However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities, as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to encroach on other producers' markets. Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly marketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil's market share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mln bags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial relations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stance at the ICO talks, they added.

A Portuguese court has made a preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders open to private importers, grain traders and officials said. Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990. Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first liberalised 20 pct share of the country's annual import needs. The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders. Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon's civil court, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not be allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders. Trade sources said the ruling, though effective immediately, was subject to appeal and would have to be confirmed in further proceedings. A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said that, as a result of the court's decision, the Commission would not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being held today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn. Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly. It also said the participation of EPAC, which still controls the national grain storage and distribution network, was unfair competition to the private traders. Traders said they believed the EC's Executive Commission was unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring to leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue. ""They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile,"" one trader said. ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if necessary. Reuter "
[u'retail', u'usa']|"U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND - ANALYSTS

U.S. retail sales rose sharply in February but many economists said the underlying consumer spending trend remains weak. February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0 pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January's sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously reported 5.8 pct decline. ""The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a much more sluggish pace,"" said Don Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc. Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data over past four months to show that the pace of consumer spending is slowing. Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4 pct rise for year-over-year sales through February. ""You can see a pattern developing,"" Maude said. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales probably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in February."" Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline. ""The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains in durable goods as well as non-durables,"" noted Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. ""It was a pretty healthy report."" He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January. ""There are signs of life in the economy,"" McCarthy said. ""But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report into the future."" A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost spending in February, he said. ""A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding taxes from their paychecks,"" he said. ""When people in this country get an increase in disposable income, the inclination is to go out and spend it,"" he said. Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales for the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of how much this sector will add to first quarter spending. Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of total February sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws January 1, the Commerce Department noted. Some economists argued that the because the gain in total sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the strength in the February report is less than impressive. ""There is strength in the February data, but that's because they were compared to low sales levels in January,"" said said Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ""We don't see it as a precursor of continued strength."" Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling 17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained 1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January. Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February, following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales probably accounted for these gains. Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in February rose to 122.29 billion dlrs. ""On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mln dlrs in the first quartrer,"" she said. ""We don't look at this as indication that the economy is barrelling along."" ""The number is not really that problematic for those of us who are constructive on the bond market,"" agreed Elliot Platt of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report. ""The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so confusing,"" he said. ""Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll employment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in March,"" he said. ""But now Fed officials will have to wait for the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in April to sort things out."" Reuter "

The Securities and Exchange Commission removed a key regulatory obstacle to trading futures on designated foreign debt securities on U.S. exchanges. The move would allow the Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, to apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, for approval of a futures contract on yen bonds. The CBT has said it may apply for approval of the yen bond futures contract, a CFTC spokesman said. The SEC's action, which was approved by a 4-0 vote, specifically removes a regulation against trading futures on designated foreign government debt securities on contract markets that are not located in the country that issued those securities. Futures on the government debt securities of Japan, Canada and Great Britain can already be marketed in the United States under a designated exemption issued by the SEC. But the new move would permit U.S. exchanges to apply to the CFTC for approval of establishing futures contracts on those securities, SEC officials said. The new SEC move would also allow those foreign government debt securities to be marketed in the United States by countries other than those that issued the securities, the officials said. Since the foreign government securities underlying the futures cannot be traded in the United States unless they are registered with the SEC, settlement and delivery of the futures would often take place in the foreign country, the SEC officials said. The SEC is also considering expanding futures trading of additional countries' government securities to be marketed and traded in the United States, the officials said. Reuter "

Uncertainty is growing about the prospects for the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scale back investment plans, the German Savings Banks and Giro Association said. Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, while industry is less optimistic than it was, the association said in a report. However, last month's agreement among the six leading western industrialized countries to keep currencies around present levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence for exporters, it added. The banking association said the possibility of using monetary policy to stimulate the economy should not be overestimated. Another small drop in already low interest rates could not be expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of consumer or capital goods, it said. The Bundesbank's half-point cuts in the discount and Lombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope for any further monetary moves, the association added. On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said gross national product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar adjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the third quarter. The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNP in the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively weak.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. exporters when he visits that country next month. In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said the Reagan administration will ask Tokyo to remove its quotas on U.S. beef and citrus exports. Lyng, who plans to be in Japan April 14-27, said he will not ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market. ""We will urge that they consider sharing their rice market,"" he said. The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of the Japanese rice market the U.S. would request. ""We've got none of it now. If we got one per cent of it, it would be a big improvement,"" he said. Last year, the Reagan administration rejected a petition by the U.S. rice industry seeking relief from Japanese import restrictions. However, the U.S. said it would reexamine the issue if by mid-1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to U.S. rice exports. Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiations next month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas, but that his visit ""may be a forerunner in a general way"" to talks prior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988. He said, however, that the U.S. ""will ask for a definite liberalization of those items (beef and citrus).... When you translate 'liberalization' into Japanese, it means do away with the quota.""

Union Pacific Corp said it will sign a pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA, to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi, Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum Co subsidiary. The sale will also include the related marketing and distribution system for the refinery's products. A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be issued later today giving details of the transaction. There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New York. The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000 barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the transaction. The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector. Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked for in any acquisition. One PDVSA official said the company was looking for independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution network and a strong regional presence. The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's SLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary. In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock. The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured source of supply, trade sources said.

Niagara Mohawk Power Co said the existing ball-type main steam isolation valves installed at Unit Two of the Nine Mile Nuclear Station will be replaced with standard Y-pattern globe valves. This decision will delay start-up of the power plant for about three to four months, resulting in a delay in commercial operation of the plant to as late as the beginning of 1988, the utility said. It previously had projected commercial operation in September. The possibility of a delay to the first quarter 1988 was raised by Rochester Gas and Electric Corp RGS> last week. Niagara Mohawk said the delay will add to the plant's cost at the rate of about 60 mln dlrs per month. A spokesman said this includes a total of about 10 mln dlrs for removing the old valves and buying and installing the new ones. The utility said the total anticipated cost of the plant is now about six billion dlrs, up from the 5.87 billion dlrs projected previously. This has increased the minimum overall disallowances under the settlement Nine Mile Two's owners reached with New York state regulators to over 2.1 billion dlrs, it added. Niagara Mohawk has a 41 pct interest in Nine Mile Two, making its share of the disallowance about 1.1 billion dlrs before income tax effects.

The utility said the replacement valves are manufactured by Rockwell International Inc ROK>. The company said it spent considerable time testing and modifying the ball valves which, until recently, ""demonstrated potential for both improvement in performance and in ease of maintenance."" ""Since activities to date have not yet proven to be completely successful and because of timing and resulting additional cost of achieving the leak tightness standard is uncertain, we have no choice but to replace them,"" Niagara Mohawk said of the ball valves.

The National Wildlife Federation rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration. The federation, the nation's largest conservation group, said further study was needed to assess any possible damage that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, called the Interior's research into the effects of development ""so fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on which to make a public policy decision."" Hair called the department's proposal a ""reflection of a largely political decision,"" adding ""we have no confidence in Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area."" Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen. It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration. Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10 billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain. Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development. Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct. He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas, fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection Agency on the possible effects of exploration. The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the issue and report back to Congress in about two years. Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible exploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to make a sound judgement. Congressional observers said that at present there was little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil. reuter "

Eurobond prices in the floating rate note sector slumped across the board by as much as a full point on some issues. ""Today has been irrational, irresponsible -- possibly the worst day in what has been a dire six months for the floater market,"" commented a senior FRN trader at a U.K. Bank. Republic of Ireland FRNs were marked sharply down in initial trading and market nerves soon infected other supra-national and sovereign paper with dealers attributing the falls to aggressive professional shorting by a few leading U.S. Investment houses. The FRN market has been suffering from acute contraction of liquidity and consequent drain of investor confidence since the effective collapse in the market for perpetual floating rate issues late last year. Since then, FRN specialists noted that retail interest has been sparse or completely absent and the stagnant market for floating rate paper has become increasingly vulnerable to manipulation, with nerves affecting all variety of borrowers. Floating rate debt of U.S. And Canadian banks came under pressure last month when fears resurfaced about their exposure to Latin American debt. Canadian banks were hard hit today. Fears about the Irish economy, exacerbated by recent post-electoral political wrangling in Dublin, prompted a sell-off of Ireland paper this morning with both dollar and mark-denominated Irish issues tumbling by a full point or more. However, FRN dealers polled by Reuters felt the Irish issues had been singled out -- as the U.S. And Canadian banks were most recently -- as the market's most vulnerable sector. ""A handful of professional houses are targetting the weak paper, shorting it aggressively and this is just starting the domino effect with basically sound paper also starting to roll with it,"" a senior FRN market source explained. Although floating paper from better-regarded borrowers such as the U.K. Managed to finish the day only around 10 basis points down, other sovereigns like Sweden and supranationals like Eurofima suffered heavier losses, FRN dealers said. Debt exposure fears continued to undermine U.S. And Canadian bank paper with one U.K. House citing a fall of 1-5/8 point on the day on a Royal Bank of Canada issue. FRN traders noted Japanese investors, initially enthusiastic floating rate debt buyers, had lost confidence in the market and speculated that a crisis meeting, such as the one called upon the collapse of the perpetuals, could be imminent. ""Retail clients just don't want to know about the floaters any more so it has degenerated to a wily pass-the-parcel among the professionals, all scheming to sweep the paper under the carpet,"" another senior FRN trader said. ""I don't know what is going to happen to the market. It can't go on like this,"" he added. In the fixed-rate sector, trading was dull with the market still attempting to digest a heavy volume of new issues from earlier this week although primary market activity slowed somewhat today, trading and syndicate sources reported. Dollar straight bonds ended the day barely changed from opening levels as investors failed to react on the unexpectedly large 4.1 pct rise in U.S. February retail sales, prefering to wait for tomorrow's producer price and business inventory data. A 100 mln dlr deal for Norsk Hydro was launched later in the day and the issue was trading around its total two pct fees at close of grey market trade although dealers said the borrower's frequent appearance in the euromarkets could deter investors. The Canadian dollar sector however saw good two-way trade and a continuation of recent healthy volume as the Canadian dollar rides high on the foreign exchanges and futures markets. Dealers said the strength of the Canadian dollar, which has firmed especially over the last two days, has renewed end investors confidence in the currency. A new Canadian dollar issue for Hydro Quebec was seeing excellent demand, sector specialists said, and the issue was quickly increased to a total of 150 mln dlrs from 125 mln. ""This kind of paper can be hard to sell and it is gratifying to see such a high level of interest, both European and domestic Canadian demand,"" commented one trader at a Canadian house. Eurosterling, which has been in the limelight lately, also on foreign exchange and currency bullishness, slipped slightly. Senior eurosterling sources noted that bond prices fell back today, more or less in line with losses seen on the U.K. Government bond market -- around 5/8 point lower at the longer end of the eurosterling market. Dealers said overseas investors had not been buying today and predicted consolidation before next week's U.K. Budget. A 55 mln stg convertible issue for confectioners Rowntree Mackintosh was well bid at 104-5/8 105-1/8 pct and expected to go well.

""In this case a degree of criminal energy has been brought into play which until now was unimaginable in a German company,"" he said in a radio interview. He could not completely rule out the possibility that losses would exceed 500 mln marks, but said there were currently no signs that they would be higher than the 480 mln announced on Tuesday. Some 70 to 80 mln marks had probably been lost through disregard for internal instructions, he added, but did not elaborate. However, the remainder had definitely been lost through criminal action and forgery in 1984. Ratjen said the affair would lead to consequences up to the board room. He would recommend that those under suspicion of being involved in criminal acts would have to go immediately. Those who had not exercised checking functions sufficiently would also have to go. But Volkwagen management board chairman Carl Hahn was not involved in the affair, he said. A Volkswagen spokesman said the company had made sufficient provision in previous years to cover the losses from the fraud. Its 1986 profit would, therefore, match 1985 world group net profits of 595.6 mln marks. Volkwagen disclosed the existence of the fraud on Tuesday, saying it was possible that documents about currency hedging had been falsified and that those responsible may have come from outside Volkswagen and may have been assisted by company staff. Criminal complaints on suspicion of fraud, breach of trust and forgery of documents had been filed, it added. The company spokesman said the supervisory board would meet on April 9 to examine the precise extent of the losses and to approve the year-end results.

Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible downward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed by consumers under certain circumstances. The sources said this means that any possible adjustment would centre on the reference price, and the ""may buy"" (or ""may sell"") and ""must buy"" (or ""must sell"") levels without changing the ""lower indicative price"" (or floor price) of 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact. The present five-day average of the indicator price is around 192 Malaysian/Singapore cents. Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price, set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo, and of the ""lower indicative price"" if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes. Consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals instead of the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism to respond automatically to market trends. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact. Reuter "

[u'gold', u'uk']|"""BRITANNIA"" COIN TO SELL AT PREMIUM

The new British one ounce gold coin, the ""Britannia,"" will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the day of purchase plus a ""competitive premium,"" Treasury officials said. Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members of the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreign coins, although transactions between members of the London Gold Market and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. No decision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins. Although a number of gold coins, especially the Canadian Maple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the place of the South African krugerrand, the British government still feels that there is a gap in the market for a British one ounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available at present is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold. Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be used in the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be bought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would be difficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases. No details are yet available on how many coins will be issued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that the amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price. There were some enquiries on the ""Britannia"" from coin dealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor in the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put off many investors, traders said. Some said that the ""Britannia"" had come too late, with the Canadian Maple Leaf, the American Eagle and other gold coins already well established. Reuter "

A proposal the London Metal Exchange, LME, change its new clearing system, due to start May 29, was made today at a meeting of LME members and International Commodities Clearing House, ICCH, representatives. Amalgamated Metal Trading Ltd, AMT, proposed that a daily cash-cleared system common to all other markets should be adopted, rather than the system currently planned whereby prompt dates are settled when they mature. AMT claims the margin requirements for the latter will be costly. Opposition to the proposal came mainly from trade and industry representatives who, as traditional users of the Exchange's hedging facilities, said a cash-cleared system would be more costly for them. LME Board Chairman Jacques Lion said any major alterations to the planned new clearing system would have to be referred to the Securities and Investment Board, SIB, and this could be time consuming, bearing in mind the May 29 start-up. There was also a risk of the Exchange losing its greatest asset, its trade hedging business, he said. Lion accepted a proposal that, while clearing with the ICCH continue as planned, details of AMT's cash clearing system be circulated for consideration and discussion by LME Board, Committee and members for possible introduction at a later date.

A member of the board which regulates the Farm Credit System predicted the troubled farm lender may lose about 900 mln dlrs in the first half of 1987, hastening the need for a federal rescue this year. Speaking to the House subcommittee responsible for farm credit issues, Farm Credit Administration (FCA) board member Jim Billington said ""My recommendation is that legislation (aiding the system) must be moved prior to June, 30, 1987, or it will be difficult to close the (farm credit system) books."" Billington's loss prediction is gloomier than either the system or its regulator had previously admitted. The system itself has so far predicted losses for all of 1987 will reach only 1.1 billion dlrs, down from 1.9 billion in 1986 and 2.7 billion in 1985. However, Billington said the system is losing in excess of 400 mln dlrs per quarter, implying total losses for 1987 of more than 1.6 billion. Losses of that magnitude would exhaust the 1.4 billion dlrs in capital surplus the system held at the end of 1986. The system also has 4.2 billion dlrs in capital held by its member borrowers, called borrower stock, which theoretically could be used as capital. Billington said by the end of 1987, more than 1.6 billion dlrs of the 4.2 billion in borrower stock would be downgraded in value because of the mounting losses. Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, urged that Congress begin to consider legislation rescuing the system by Easter and that a bill be completed by the fall. Chairman of the House subcommittee, Rep. Ed Jones, (D-Tenn.) said today ""the time has arrived to consider assistance to save the system."" The Senate Democratic leadership indicated last month that it would begin drafting a bailout bill by Easter. FCA board members differed on whether a direct government infusion of cash will be needed to rescue the system. FCA chairman Naylor said a federal guarantee of both borrower stock and system bonds held by investors might avoid the need to provide ""hard capital"" to the system.

Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at 140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd. Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have been rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude. Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said. Garrone's refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) is due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the jointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity 220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th following its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman said. The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said. In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de BP's Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is 181,900 bpd.

Standard and Poor's noted that Resorts International remains highly leveraged, with significant near-term financing requirements for the completion of its new casino/hotel in Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal.

A former broker at PaineWebber Inc was charged by a federal grand jury with involvement in a 700,000 dlr money-laundering scheme, according to indictment papers. Gary Eder, 41, a former vice-president at PaineWebber, was charged with conspiracy and falsifying brokerage records in the two-count indictment. According to the indictment, Eder produced more brokerage commissions than any other broker at PaineWebber, and was its most highly-paid broker between 1982-86. Eder is charged with conspiring with unnamed supervisors at PaineWebber to prevent the filing of Currency Transaction Reports with the Internal Revenue Service. Federal law requires that reports be filed with the IRS for any single cash transaction in one day of more than 10,000 dlrs. Asked about the charges, a Painewebber spokeswoman said the company had not seen the indictment and had no comment. She said Eder was suspended January 22 and resigned from the firm on february 17.

[u'cocoa', u'brazil']|"PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP

Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on. This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1. ""The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December,"" one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year's output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered.

[u'acq', u'usa']|"TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER CORP PCC>

Purolator Courier corp's stock rose on specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would find a new suitor for the company, traders said. Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265 mln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of its Purolator courier division's management. The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one. Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10. The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a better deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be found if the company would agree to be sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier division. ""Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has 450 mln dlrs in revenues. It's a very large company and it's being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs,"" said Gardner in a telephone interview with Reuters. Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm associated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity companies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he personally owns 20,000 shares. A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the letter from Gardner. Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the transaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also speculated another courier company would be the most likely suitor. While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no new bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed the stock into play again. ""There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question of management's willingness to let the process continue,"" said one arbitrager. Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction. Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs cash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S. courier operations. The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and will emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in Purolator. ""As far as I can tell from the public documents from the deal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero. One always likes a situation like that. You always like to think if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be someone else in the world that could do it higher,"" said one arbitrager. The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the firm will not end up paying for its equity position. While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document did note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to keep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some risk to the firm. ""There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash, and all sorts of things that make it very speculative,"" said one of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to employees. The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs in so-called ""bridge"" financing for the transaction. The bridge financing is a temporary loan from Hutton. The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing, expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to replace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could be a substantial expense to the firm. Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln dlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction said fees are at the low end of the scale. ""It's a very complex transaction, but basically what happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture any investment they might have once the merger takes place,"" Gardner said.

Implementation of a one-year 0/92 pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions. ""We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame, but we are locked into this,"" said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.), chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains. ""We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both."" Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week. Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill -- only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under the current bill. It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill, he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed. A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said. Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this point, he said. ""I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal,"" Glickman said at the hearing. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the Boren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term 0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan. Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions. ""I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but we can at least move in that direction,"" Boschwitz said. Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers' dependency on the government, he said. A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson said, and would still encourage farmers to plant. Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers. But when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

Director of the Office of Management and Budget James Miller said the Reagan administration had no intention of raising taxes in order to reduce the federal budget deficit. ""There will be no tax increases,"" he said three times before a Management Briefing luncheon of Southern Methodist University's Edwin L. Cox School of Business. The budget deficit, which is currently slated at 173 billion dlrs for fiscal 1988, is supposed to be reduced to 108 billion dlrs under the provisions of the Gramm-Rudman Act, which calls for a balanced budget by fiscal 1991. Miller said he believes the budget deficit can be reduced but added, ""the surest way to put us in a pickle"" would be to raise or ease the Gramm-Rudman goal. ""If we were to raise taxes so soon after tax reform, it would create enormous uncertainty on the financial markets,"" he said, adding that giving up on the will to reduce the deficit would also create uncertainty. Miller reiterated the president's budget proposal that the deficit could be reduced by a total of 42 billion dlrs through increased revenues and spending cuts. An additional 23 billion dlrs from economic growth is expected to result in the budget deficit being reduced to the 108 billion dlr target. Miller said it was possible the Administration might support an oil import fee, but added that the President was concerned that such a move might have more adverse results than benefits.

A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) board recommended raising the two-dollar monthly subscriber line charge for residential telephone customers by 1.50 dlrs over the next two years. The subscriber line charge was first levied by the FCC in June, 1985, in an effort to more acurately reflect the cost of providing phone service as a part of phone deregulation. The recommendation by the board, composed of federal and state utility regulators, was expected to be approved by the FCC in a seperate decision in the next few weeks. The subscriber line charge for residences and businesses with single phone lines will rise to 2.60 dlrs in June 1987, 3.20 in September 1988, and 3.50 dlrs in April 1989.

[u'usa']|"WHITE HOUSE DETAILS CREDIT REFORM LEGISLATION

The Reagan Administration sent to Congress proposed legislation that would require Congress to reflect the cost of federal loan subsidies in the government's budget. The legislation would require Congress to approve all subsidies on loans, to sell off many loans to the private sector shortly after they are made and to buy private reinsurance for many guaranteed loans. White House officials estimated reinsurance premiums could amount to six billion dlrs a year to private companies. The bill would make little impact on the federal deficit or payroll, officials said. The legislation would not in itself alter the terms of federal credit programs. But officials said they would be pleased if Congress tightened some programs after seeing their true cost set out in the budget. The program would call for the immediate sale of many newly made direct federal loans, but would no effect existing federal loan portfolios. Some of these are already proposed to be sold off under previous administration programs. Exempt from the sale requirement would be loans made under the Commodity Credit Corp commodity loan program, which the government considers to be a commodity purchase program rather than a credit program, and defaulted guaranteed loans, which the government considers to be the same as direct loans. Also excluded from the sale requirement would be most foreign loans, though officials said they may at some point consider selling off some Export-Import Bank loans. Officials said government loan programs currently amount to about 252 billion dlrs in direct loans and 450 billion dlrs in guaranteed loans a year. Officials said U.S. agencies were asked to calculate the approximate cost of their loan subsidies by looking at comparable loans in the marketplace. The administration is asking Congress to begin reflecting the cost of these subsidies in the fiscal 1988 budget, which the House Budget Committee plans to begin marking up late next week. Officials said the reforms, if adopted across-the-board by all affected congressional committees, would lower the federal deficit by only 100 mln dlrs in fiscal 1988. Officials said the administration hopes to sell a total of 13.0 billion dlrs in loan assets during fiscal 1988, including 1.8 billion dlrs in loan assets under the credit reform program and 11.2 billion dlrs in loan assets already in the governemnt's portfolion. In fiscal 1989, the administration hopes to sell 8.9 billion dlrs in loans, including 1.3 billion dlrs of loans under the credit reform program and 7.6 billion dlrs from the existing portfolio.

[u'canada']|"DOME DMP> SAYS MOST LENDERS SUPPORT DEBT PLAN

Dome Petroleum Ltd said a majority of a group of 56 major creditors support the company's revised proposal to restructure debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Outlining terms of the plan circulated to the lenders earlier this week, the company said it is seeking approval in principle for the proposal ""within the next several weeks"" in order to implement the debt rescheduling by June 30, 1987. ""Although at today's price levels it only allows the company to struggle on, benefits appear as oil prices rise,"" Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement. ""We believe the plan is a rational one, and will be valid under a range of circumstances,"" chairman Macdonald said. The lenders previously agreed to an interim debt rescheduling until June 30 to allow Dome time to negotiate a long-term recapitalization. The debt proposal is designed to ensure continued existence of the company, which would see lenders get maximum recovery of their loans, Dome said. The plan would maintain debt levels within Dome's ability to pay, subject to minimum debt service levels for each lender. Dome said the debt proposal offers measures such as equity conversion options and reclassification to lower interest bearing categories of debt to accomplish its objectives. Under certain circumstances, lenders will have the option to convert all or part of their debt to common shares at a pre-determined conversion rate upon plan implementation. The various conversion rates remain to be set through negotiations, and the company said it is impossible to predict the extent to which the conversion option will be exercised and the amount of dilution that may result. Converting debt to common shares after the plan is implemented would be at a much higher conversion price, Dome said. Common shareholders will be asked to approve the plan before it is put in place. Debt that remains after share conversion will either receive scheduled payments based on contract interest rates and a 15 to 20 year pay-out, or interest rates indexed to oil prices. The company will use both an annual security-to-debt ratio test and a monthly cash flow test to classify which interest payments are paid on the different portions of debt. To achieve a stable operating base for the company, the plan provides for deducting operating costs, capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses before the remaining available cash flow is distributed to lenders, Dome said. The proposal also assumes efforts will continue to operate the business as efficiently as possible, it said. As the company previously said, debt payments from cash flow be divided into two broad categories, secured and unsecured creditors. Terms of the debt plan include paying institutional unsecured creditors, comprising mostly banks who hold private debt, from cash flow generated by unpledged assets. This portion will get a fixed low interest rate under a 15-year repayment schedule. Remaining institutional unsecured debt will get paid through convertible, oil indexed unsecured debt that matures in 20 years, or any available excess cash flow, or conversion to equity. Any institutional lender also has the option of taking all or part of its debt in common shares. To offer public unsecured debtholders liquidity, Dome said they can also convert all or part of their debt to common shares when the plan is implemented. Any debt leftover would be exchanged for a convertible debenture with an interest rate linked to oil prices. Secured creditors would get paid from cashflow generated by the assets pledged against their debt under a complex formula, the company said. Any shortfalls under the formula could also be converted to oil-linked debentures. Reuter "
[u'usa', u'volcker']|"VOLCKER SEES PROBLEMS REMAINING IN SOME SECTORS

Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said severe problems remain in some sectors of the U.S. economy despite progress in others. ""Severe problems in some sectors of the economy are all too obvious,"" he said in remarks prepared for delivery to a luncheon of business leaders here. He said oil exploration and development, as well as agricultural prices, have been heavily affected by worldwide surpluses. Commercial construction, he said, is suffering from earlier over-building in many areas. More broadly, he said, there are distortions and imbalances in the U.S. economy that cut across many sectors. ""Unless dealt with effectively and forcibly, they will undermine all that has been achieved,"" Volcker warned. He said one problem is that economic activity over the past two years has been supported largely by consumption. He said that rising consumption was achieved at the expense of reduced personal savings. At the same time, he said, the huge Federal budget deficit is absorbing a disproportionate amount of the savings generated in the U.S. Volcker said the adverse consequences of the combination of low savings rates and high Federal budget deficits have been escaped by drawing on capital from abroad. He noted that the net flow of foreign capital into the U.S. in 1986 exceeded all the savings by U.S. households. ""That is a graphic demonstration of the extent to which our financial markets are hostage to possible changes in external attitudes and circumstances,"" Volcker said. Reuter "
[u'gnp', u'cpi', u'reserves', u'bolivia']|"BOLIVIA TO OFFER TO BUY BACK BANK DEBT

Bolivia is to make a formal offer during the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bank president Jier Nogales said. Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steering committee of Bolivia's creditor banks had agreed to consider the offer at a meeting in New York last month. He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian paper on the international secondary debt market, where it now trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value. Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the discounted rate in full. Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to 30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the international markets, he added. Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans to commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said there would be no money available to restart traditional debt servicing to them for some time. Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs, but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at discounted rates. Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in the next few months. He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over the price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would make a single non-negotiable offer. He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly creditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The only traditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which would mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss provisions, he added. ""We are confident that the banks are going to be reasonable,"" Nogales said. ""Now they can resolve their problems for once and for all."" ""The most conservative ones who want a little more will wait a year, but I don't know if the window of opportunity will be open all the time,"" he added. Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia's four billion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed to governments and the rest to international agencies, Nogales said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent discussions with the Paris Club. He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, while accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interest rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris Club rules, he added. He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with Argentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt. He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from international agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year. The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs last year, he added. Nogales said that Bolivia's net international reserves now stood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs in disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro took office in August, 1985. Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct a year in the government's first month in office, was now down to 10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and the plan was that it should continue at this level. He said the government was also expecting at least three pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative rates. Reuter "

The House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open foreign markets to more U.S. goods. The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means Committee next week, but major changes are not expected, congressional sources said. ""This product could very well be toughening our trade policy and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this frightening word 'protectionism',"" Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said. The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year. But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut by those countries. The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls, incentives for research, expanded worker training and education and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness. The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate committees. It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by U.S. actions against other countries. The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to win relief from surges of imports of competitive products. It extends until January 1993, the administration's authority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the new round of multilateral talks under the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade.

[u'l-cattle', u'livestock', u'usa']|"LIVE CATTLE RALLY AS LOCKOUT AT MEAT PLANT ENDS

Live cattle futures posted a robust rally today after a major beef packing company said it would end a lockout at its slaughtering plant in Dakota City, Neb. April delivery cattle on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange closed at 64.45 cents a pound, up 0.83 cent, as the market expected demand for live animals to increase as the plant restarts operations. Iowa Beef Processors, a division of Occidental Petroleum, said it planned to reopen the plant, one of the largest in the nation, on March 16. The plant has been closed since Dec. 14, the day after a contract between IBP and Local 222 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union expired. The plant employs 2,800 workers and can slaughter several thousand animals a day, a company spokesman said. The company said it locked out union workers because they threatened to disrupt operations. It was unclear whether union meatpackers would return to work. They rejected the company's latest contract offer March 5. Traders said cattle prices advanced at midsession as rumors circulated that the lockout was ending, and gains were further fueled by a noticeable increase in demand for live animals on cash markets in Nebraska and the Texas Panhandle. The rally in cattle also boosted values of live hogs and frozen pork bellies, which also were supported by indications that producers were expanding their hog herds at a slower rate than previously expected. Petroleum futures posted a modest rally on the New York Mercantile Exchange. But a report that the Soviet Union planned to reduce the price of its crude oil exports may pressure the market Friday, said Nauman Barakat, petroleum analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. Buying by companies that deal in petroleum helped prices recover from early weakness, traders said. Gold futures rallied, partly in response to strength in the silver market, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Silver prices rallied after a U.S. brokerage house recommended its customers buy the metal, traders said. Coffee futures drifted lower in response to a report that Colombia lowered the price of its exports, traders said. Sugar prices closed slightly higher on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange despite a large export sale by the European Commission on Wednesday. Soybeans were higher, wheat lower and corn mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans were boosted by expectations that the Agriculture Department would report a healthy signup for the Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers to leave highly erodible land idle instead of planting a crop, traders said. Concern that a strike by Brazilian seamen might interrupt exports of soybeans from Brazil, where the harvest is just beginning, also underpinned prices, they said.

The Securities and Exchange Commission asked the New York Stock Exchange to tighten an experimental procedure used in the past six months to dampen volatility linked to the so-called ""triple-witching hour."" The Big Board has been collecting and publicizing information on large imbalances of ""market-on-close"" (MOC) orders placed on 50 major stocks one-half-hour before closing on so-called expiration Fridays in September and December. Expiration Fridays, or triple witching hours, occur every three months when stock options, stock index options and futures on index options expire simultaneously. As aribrageurs liquidated their futures and options on previous expiration Fridays, they sold huge amounts of stock which they had used to offset their positions. The huge sell orders, which usually entered the market in the final frantic minutes on expiration Fridays triggered wild price swings in the 50 stocks which serve as the basis for the options and futures. The gyrations prompted the SEC last September to request that the Big Board ask its members submit all MOCs by 1530 hrs on expiration Fridays, which would then be made public, giving the market a half-hour to settle order imbalances. But in a March 12 letter to NYSE President Robert Birnbaum, SEC Director of Market Regulation cited problems in the experimental procedure during the Dec 19 expiration Friday. A large number of MOC buy orders were not placed until after 1530 EST on Dec 19, which helped send the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 21 points in the final minutes of the day to a 14.20-point gain on the day, Ketchum said. Citing the SEC's concern about such trading, Ketchum asked the exchange to tighten its procedure by not accepting any pre-existing MOC orders after 1530 if they could have been placed earlier. The new restriction, which SEC officials said merely clarifies the terms of the existing experimental procedure, would bar the liquidation of stocks through MOC orders for arbitrage purposes after 1530 hrs, even if they offset other reported order imbalances in those stocks. The only MOC orders the SEC will allow to be placed after 1530 EST on March 20, the next expiration Friday, are those that are received by Big Board member firms after 1530 EST and which help reduce existing order imbalances, Ketchum said. If there are no published imbalances in a particular stock, no MOC orders will be accepted in that stock, he said. ""If dissemination of MOC orders is to provide an accurate indication of true order imbalances, then all existing MOC orders must be submitted by 3:30 p.m. and only those new MOC orders responding to reported imbalances can be permitted,"" Ketchum said. The letter did not say how the SEC or the NYSE would determine the difference between pre-existing MOC orders that would be barred, and new MOC orders that would be allowed to reduce imbalances. But an SEC official said the agency hopes the NYSE and its members would adhere to the rules ""in a spirit of cooperation."" REUTER... "

In order to accomodate the shift in the settlement procedure for options on the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index that the exchange announced last month, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) said it has created a new class of options for the S and P contract SPX>. The CBOE's new contract was needed to coincide with changes in the settlement procedure that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) made on its S and P 500 futures and options contract which will be implemented with the expiration of the June contract. Settlement of the CBOE's new option contract will be based on the opening price of the S and P 500 index on expiraton day, while settlement of the current contract is based on the closing price of the index. ""CBOE doesn't think that opening settlement is the solution to the expiration effect, but we cannot exposure investors in our market to unanticipated risks arising from different settlement times in options and futures,"" CBOE chairman Alger Chapman said in a release. ""We're taking this step to give investors a choice of settlement times that meet their hedging needs,"" Chapman said. The new contract was necessary because the Options Clearing Corp (OCC) did not allow its member exchanges to modify terms of any of its outstanding contracts, the CBOE said.

[u'money-supply', u'interest', u'usa']|"FED DATA INDICATE NO POLICY CHANGE LIKELY

U.S. bank reserve, monetary and discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve today clearly indicate that policy is ""on hold"" and may not be changed for weeks or even months, economists said. ""The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy,"" said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co. ""These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change,"" said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc. Fed data released today were all in line with economists' expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks. The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln dlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that. It said that banks' net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously. Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6 billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs. Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3 pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actual positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3. February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and 20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target. ""In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money growth,"" said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc. Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in March after February's anemic growth rates. However, they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness. Commenting on February's decline in the key M-2 aggregate, Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February's weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2 and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March. Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the Fed. Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves. Given the economy's fragility in many sectors, the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next changes policy. ""Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six pct,"" said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week. The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added reserves directly through two-day System repurchases. Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate be largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs. Reuter "

Colombia intends to improve the marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on setting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar Gaviria said. Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export registration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock New York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile. ""In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that will allow private exporters to participate more actively in Colombia's coffee export policy,"" he said. Traders said this means the export registration price will change more often in a truer reflection of market trends. Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market factors since a return to a system of International Coffee Organisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short term. ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986. Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices with increased volume. ""Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of coffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will do so without an agreement among producers,"" he said. He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5 mln bags as mentioned in market circles, ""because the idea is precisely not to disrupt the market."" Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September 30. Echoing Gaviria's words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national coffee growers' federation, said Colombia sought to adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances. ""There is great expectation in the world for the policies that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the immediate future,"" he told journalists. Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week. Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks have been resolved. Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the Brazilian stand was quite clear. He said Brazil's current quota ""reflects the reality of the market, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand,"" but added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that determined it. Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible, which did not happen.

Institutional investors are finding it difficult to find ""the best price"" for transactions in U.K. Government bonds (gilts) and have become more active in the market since the deregulation of the London Stock Exchange in October, agency broker Capel-Cure Myers said in a survey. The survey, covering a broad section of institutional investors, also showed that investors were uneasy about the impartiality of market makers' advice. Given their concerns, over half those surveyed said they spend more time managing their portfolios. At the same time, the investors believed the market was more liquid and efficient than before Big Bang. Capel-Cure, a unit of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, conducted the survey during January among 70 institutions which are not clients of that firm. Banks and merchant banks accounted for 32 pct of the total, building societies 30 pct, life assurance companies 20 pct, insurance companies 11 pct and pension funds seven pct. The survey found that with the virtual elimination of commissions, the improved market liquidity has encouraged investors to deal more frequently in the market. Of those responding, 70 pct were encouraged to deal more actively, 25 pct which saw no change and five pct dealt less actively. A Capel-Cure official told reporters the elimination of commissions has made the market more competitive. He said Capel-Cure has deliberately set low commisstions because of this. Nearly half the respondents said they now have their own dealing team to cope with the new market, although the definition of a ""dealing team"" was ambiguous, the survey said. Rather than being a self-contained, specialised group of dealers who spend all their time searching for prices, the definition now appears to be the less formal idea of a multi-purpose fund manager, it said. The survey supported the general view in the gilt market that a shake-out of the 27 market-makers is likely. It showed nearly 90 pct of the respondents believed that the total number of market makers in three years time would be less than 20, while 46 pct thought the number would be less than 15. Some 79 pct of respondents said they expect the number of agency brokers (for which there was no estimate) to fall over the next three years. Unlike broker/dealers, agency brokers do not take positions in the market, but the survey showed 68 pct of respondents did not consider this very important when deciding whether to use one. REUTER "

Debt talks between the Philippine government and its bank advisory committee were delicately poised after a brief meeting between the two sides today, bankers and sources close to the Philippine delegation said. ""We had a businesslike meeting and made good progress,"" a banker said. ""The banks are anxious to come to an agreement."" But bankers were reluctant to predict whether the talks would end successfully. Caution was also evident in the Philippine camp. ""We feel the ball's in the banks' court,"" one source said. The two sides will meet again on Friday. The talks, in which the Philippines is seeking to reschedule about 9.4 billion dlrs of debt, are now dominated by a discussion of the innovative proposal made by finance minister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of the country's interest bill in Philippine Investment Notes, PINs, instead of cash. Manila wants to pay the London Interbank Offered Rate in cash and to issue PINs in respect of the margin above LIBOR. The banks rejected the original PINs proposal last Friday, but Ongpin presented a revised proposal on Monday which sought to satisfy the banks' objections by guaranteeing that the notes would yield 7/8 pct over LIBOR in cash. The banks have apparently yet to pass final judgment on the new proposal. Senior Reagan Administration officials expressed warm support for the PINs proposal this week, which gave Ongpin hope that the banks would embrace the idea. But the banks are still being circumspect, weighing possible accounting consequences as well as considering the precedents that they would set if they agreed to PINS. One of the main architects of the PINs proposal, U.S. lawyer Lee Buchheit, is adamant that the banks have nothing to worry about. ""To the extent that it's a precedent, it's a precedent to be encouraged,"" Buchheit, a partner with Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton, told a debt-equity swaps conference sponsored by Euromoney magazine. Under the proposal, banks would sell the dollar-denominated PINs at a discount to multinational firms which would convert them into pesos at face value to fund government-approved equity investments in the Philippines. In effect, international firms would be paying part of Manila's interest bill, allowing the government to conserve much-needed hard currency. One of the beauties of the scheme, according to Buchheit, is that it widens the scope of third-world debt negotiations, which have been confined to debtors and creditors for the past 4-1/2 years. ""There's another pool of cash at the table now,"" he said. David Mulford, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, told the Euromoney conference that ideas such as PINs should be part of a ""menu"" of options available to banks instead of pure new-money packages. He said the difficulty of syndicating Mexico's 7.7 billion dlr loan package shows that new approaches must be encouraged. ""We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devising new money packages may, in effect, be essential to future bank syndications,"" Mulford said. In an unusually frank comment about the Mexican deal, he said that dissatisfaction with Mexico's economic program and criticism of communication and coordination within the bank syndicate had prompted a number of banks to refuse to participate in the loan. This refusal ""for a time appeared to jeopardize the prospects for successful agreement with the rest of the banks,"" Mulford said. The Mexican package is now due to be signed on March 20, but bankers said the U.S. clearly feels the need to breathe new life into the financing process, especially with crucial negotiations with Brazil, about to start. The banks for their part insist that they are more than willing to discuss Mulford's ""menu"", and say it is the debtors that need to be more flexible. For example, they say financing talks with Argentina are proving tough because Buenos Aires dislikes the debt-equity schemes and onlending provisions that the banks are promoting. But whether the banks are ready to endorse the PINs concept right away still hangs in the balance. Reuter "

[u'gnp', u'usa', u'sprinkel']|"U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT

Senior U.S. Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets. Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth. By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987. Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments. He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely. Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988. Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, ""It looks pretty good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports."" He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding, ""It looks like they're on track."" While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit, Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact. The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives, he said. ""Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform,"" Sprinkel said. ""In 1986, this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family."" Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit. In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said. Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same. ""Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years,"" Sprinkel said. ""This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,"" he added. However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided. ""Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit) are unpleasant,"" he said. Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the ""biggest sustained inflation in our nation's history,"" which helped foster widespread distrust of government. ""The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level,"" Penner said. ""But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot."" Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year. He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed. ""I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there's no ... Way to enforce it,"" Penner said. Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets. ""Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved more than two billion dlrs,"" Penner said. REUTER "

[u'sugar', u'china']|"CHINA FACES DILEMMA OVER SUGAR IMPORTS

China has to decide if it will increase sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and rising demand, in view of market predictions that international sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the official press said. He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in production last year but he gave no price details. One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly because of improving living standards and rising demand for sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods. ""It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a state-controlled economy. China may have to import,"" he said. Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in 1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in January 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986. The official Economic Information newspaper last month said production in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April) will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand. The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24 mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes. ""In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped and cannot meet demand that is rising every day,"" it said. ""The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw down stocks to meet market demand,"" it added. It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them. The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane. Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said. In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added. The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing money. China has 521 sugar mills. A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct in Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of China's sugar in calendar 1985. He said both provinces are more developed than other sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities. But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87, because cane-growing is more economic there, he said. He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986. A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end-January. ""Now they are falling but (they) have not reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,"" he said. ""China has options not easily available in western countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly,"" he said. The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are likely to continue until at least end-1988. He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-owned mills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers. ""Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many of them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s,"" he said. He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual four pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct. REUTER "

It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 level of 23.2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding is expected to be slower than previously forecast. Beef producers are becoming more confident that higher returns in the market, both domestically and overseas, will continue, the AMLC said.

It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion of output remains much the same as last year when it was around 55 pct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct.

Expanding global links between futures markets mean that the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) must add Chicago and London to its list of rivals, banking sources said.

Restrictions on investments by Japanese residents have also inhibited the growth of the futures contracts in both Singapore and Sydney, the banking sources said. Nevertheless, all 450 seats on SIMEX are now taken, with the last trading at 55,000 dlrs against the initial price of 50,000 dlrs. The current bid is 55,500 dlrs, but offers at 65,000 show that confidence in SIMEX remains, said Michael Killian, general manager of Chase Manhattan Futures Corp. Killian, a SIMEX board member, said the CBOT night session might raise arbitrage opportunities and SIMEX would benefit from a local stock exchange index contract planned for the end of 1987. SIMEX also became more competitive after this month's budget eliminated withholding tax on interest earned on futures margin deposits. Banking sources said the tax change would boost SIMEX trading by non-bank institutions and individuals and would benefit foreign firms and institutions. While the Treasury bond contract has been somewhat disappointing, other SIMEX contracts continue to expand, Fong Yew Meng, SIMEX assistant general manager, told Reuters. Volume in the SIMEX's Nikkei stock index, based on the Tokyo stock market, has risen to a daily average of more than 1,000 contracts this month, from 320 contracts last October, helped by uncertainty during the recent bull run in Tokyo stocks, Fong said. Open interest in the Nikkei contract, introduced last year, reached a record 2,697 on February 26. Killian said the Nikkei contract has considerable potential for expansion, as overseas investors have been avoiding the contract because they currently see no need to hedge the rising cash market in Tokyo. SIMEX is also enjoying record trading in other contracts. In February, total volume on the exchange reached a record 122,819 contracts, surpassing the previous monthly record of 116,767 set in September. Eurodollar volume reached a record 78,546 contracts last month against 70,306 in September. SIMEX is likely to try to maintain its growth by moving into options soon, but competition continues regionally as well as globally, banking sources said. The Sydney exchange plans to introduce by June a share index futures contract based on a composite of stocks on which equity options are traded, which could generate more liquidity than the ordinary index, banking sources said. Local interest in the Sydney Treasury bond contract may also flare if the Sydney exchange establishes a three-way link with Chicago and London, traders in Sydney said. LIFFE is discussing such a link with the CBOT, they said. REUTER "

A Foreign Ministry official dismissed arguments made by senior U.S. Government officials seeking to block the sale of a U.S. Microchip maker to a Japanese firm. ""They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues,"" Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry's North American Division told Reuters. U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the sale of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd ITSU.T>, U.S. Officials said yesterday. Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale. U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while Japan's supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales. Takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner, Schlumberger Ltd SLB>, does not include Fairchild's main defence-related division. In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make supercomputers. Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said. Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying ""the purchase would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor market."" Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said. The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said. U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite U.S. Firms' technological lead in the field. ""The United States believes Japan will only react when bullied, and this is a bullying ploy,"" Salomon Brothers Asia analyst Carole Ryavec said. However, the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors. ""The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,"" said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co. U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market. A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those set by the pact. ""It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,"" he told Reuters. Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with Schlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters. REUTER "

[u'uk']|"TAX REVENUES BOOST U.K. BUDGET OPTIONS

A mix of electoral boldness and fiscal caution is expected from Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson next week when he unveils his budget for fiscal 1987/88. Exceptionally robust tax revenues have given Lawson very favourable budget options with which to please voters, industry and financial markets alike. The budget will Lawson's fourth, and probably the last from the Conservative government before the next general election, political analysts say. Analysts said the major budget question is how Lawson will balance expected tax cuts with lower public borrowing, and allow for fresh falls in U.K. Interest rates. They said a boost given to the economy by consumer spending has helped reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) for financial 1986/87 from an originally targetted 7.1 billion stg, despite big rises in government spending. Economists say Lawson may have up to five billion stg to split between income tax cuts and other electoral ""sweeteners,"" higher spending and a drop in borrowing, while still meeting his earlier 1987/88 PSBR target of 7.0 billion stg. The decision facing Lawson is how best to use that so-called ""fiscal adjustement"" to maximise the government's all-round popularity ahead of the next general election. Economist Ian Harwood of Warburg Securities said Lawson's budget must strike a balance between tax cuts aimed at home consumption and lower public borrowing for attracting support from overseas investors. Peter Fellner of James Capel and Co said ""a budget which concentrates on tax cuts for the consumer will be a budget for an early election."" Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher must call a poll before June, 1988. But anticipation of a summer or autumn 1987 ballot has risen as the opposition Labour Party has slipped in voter surveys. Forecasts that the economy may deteriorate later this year add to arguments for an early poll, analysts say. The Conservatives have pledged to cut the basic rate of taxation in the U.K. From the current 29 pct level to 25 pct. While confirming that aim, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher last month seemed to dash speculation that that would happen in the near future. She said in a television interview that it would happen ""Eventually. But I think it will be eventually."" Most market analysts now expect a two-pence reduction in the basic rate of taxation and a lowering in of the top rate of income tax from 60 pct. A one billion stg cut in the 1987/88 PSBR - to six billion stg - is considered the minimum needed for reassuring financial markets, they add. The Treasury's inflow of tax receipts has far surpassed that previously envisaged, economists say. Lawson as recently as December 17 said that ""I very much doubt whether there will be much scope for reductions in taxation in next year's budget."" The Conservative government is eager to get the basic rate of tax down to 25 pct as soon as possible, since every pound off the tax base would make the opposition Labour Party's spending plans look more painful to the electorate, analysts say. The direct revenue effect of a one penny change in the basic rate of income tax would be about 1.1 billion stg in 1987/88 and 1.45 billion stg in 1988/89, Treasury figures show. Lawson's budget speech to Parliament on Tuesday starts at 1530 GMT, and is sure to echo the government's distinct tone of optimism, analysts say. The tax measures which Lawson is expected to announce will be based firmly on a positive assessment of past economic achievements and confidence for the future, they add. But even if he does cut his planned PSBR for 1987/88 by between one and 1.5 billion stg, as most economists predict, Lawson is still likely to find himself announcing a higher PSBR than the outturn for this financial year.^M That could leave him with a presentation problem, economists say. A lower PSBR would raise financial confidence by reassuring markets that the borrowing burden imposed by the government would stay low even if certain key aspects of the budget's arithmetic seem over-optimistic, economists say Lawson is slated to reaffirm the government's goals, as set out in its Medium Term Financial Strategy (MTFS), of reducing inflation and raising economic growth. Regarding monetary targets, some analysts expect him to drop the wayward broad money aggregate, sterling M-3, while retaining the tamer M0 narrow measure. Few foresee any other monetary aggregate being chosen by Lawson for formal targeting. Analysts were surprised this week when the government sanctioned a half percentage point cut in interest rates, in an attempt to cool down sterling and the gilts market. Analysts had expected the authorities to wait until after the budget. Further declines in bank base lending rates are anticipated after the budget. Many analysts foresee them falling by as much as a full percentage point from the current 10.5 pct level. The main electoral attraction of reducing interest rates is to cut mortgage borrowing costs, and thus reduce inflation, analysts say. Each one percentage point cut in the mortgage rate reduces retail prices by 0.4 pct, government figures show. REUTER "

SPK said Kampuchea planned to expand planting from 1.5 mln to 1.93 mln hectares and boost rice paddy output to 2.5 mln tonnes this calendar year. Two mln tonnes of paddy would produce some 1.3 mln tonnes of milled rice, above the 1.25 mln tonnes Kampuchea says is the minimum its 7.5 mln people need. REUTER "

China's 1987 cotton output must rise above the 1986 level of 3.54 mln tonnes or supply will fall short of increasing demand, the China Daily said. Demand in 1986 rose 10.9 pct over 1985. Output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a record 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show. The China Daily attributed the decline to several factors, including less favorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrict cotton production after the 1984 build-up of stocks. According to Customs figures, cotton exports rose to 558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985. To increase output quickly, the state will raise by 10 pct the price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quota levels, the newspaper said. Its official purchasing agencies will buy cotton produced in excess of that originally contracted for, it added. The China Daily said all cotton growing areas in south China should be maintained, and growing in the north should be concentrated in Hebei, Shandong, Henan and Xinjiang. It called for comprehensive planning to coordinate production of cotton with that of grain, edible oil and other crops, but gave no more details. REUTER "

Export director Carlos Santana told reporters the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of consumption. He said the Saudis reported they would no longer accept letters of credit from the Bank of Brazil or even from Saudi banks and that Brazil would have to obtain credit guarantees from leading international banks. In February, Brazil had contracted to buy 125,000 bpd from the Saudis until June. Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.

Sandoz AG SANZ.Z> would have reported a percentage rise in net profits ""close to double figures"" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for November's warehouse fire, a senior company official said. The official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which caused severe pollution of the Rhine. Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share. This year began well, with the performance in January and February at least equal to the same period last year, the official said. The company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on April 22. Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident. The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the ""one pct"" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire. Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the Rhine since the accident. However, the official said the final figure would be ""much less than that cited in earlier comments."" He gave no further details.

Schweizerische Aluminimum AG ALUZ.Z> (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said. ""The threshold of profitability has returned to the foreseeable future,"" he said. ""We expect already in 1987 approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that our industrial environment does not worsen."" He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past losses. Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986 after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985. Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion. Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for 1985. But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news conference the new management installed a year ago had decided to restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminate rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an asset. Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from 472 mln in 1985. It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining, after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in 1985. Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from 1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves and exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a 50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22. Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this ""radical elimination of the mortgages of the past"" painful, but said the foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy. Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity was strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56 billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion. Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111 mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct in 1985. In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp SBVZ.Z> and Credit Suisse CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan. The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987. Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts. That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169 mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a 479 mln loss instead of 179 mln. The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of 1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar alternations were made for previous years. After 1986 losses, shareholder's equity stood at only 895 mln francs. REUTER "

The Singapore government owns or backs 608 companies under three holding companies with total assets in access of 10 billion dlrs, the report said. The report said a study of 99 glcs showed that 41 of them should be privatised, 52 should not be privatised, and six should be studied further because they have foreign government participation, serve a ""social mission,"" or are defence-related. Of the 41, 15 should seek listing on The Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ), including shipyards, printing firms and airport service firms. The government should privatise a further 17, including Intraco Ltd (a government trading firm), Chemical Industries (FE) Ltd, and Acma Electrical Industries Ltd, and reduce its stake in nine, it added. These included Singapore Airlines, SIA, now 63 pct-owned by the government's Temasek Holdings, The Development Bank of Singapore DBSM.SI>, Keppel Corp Ltd KPLM.SI>, Sembawang Shipyard Ltd BAWH.SI> and Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. The ceiling on foreign ownership of SIA should be allowed to rise to 49 pct from the current 20 pct, it said.

Trading in shares of SIA, which has a paid-up capital of 619 mln dlrs, closed here today at 10.60 dlrs. The report said the government's 48 pct stake in DBS, one of Singapore's four major local banks, should be cut to 30 pct through public offerings or dilution by issuing new shares. Among firms which should not be privatised, nine are to be wound up, it said, including storage and food trading firms. The report said seven statutory boards should be considered for privatisation so as to reduce competition with the private sector, with a 20 pct ceiling on foreign ownership. The seven include the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore, the Public Utilities Board, the Port of Singapore Authority, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Broadcasting Corp.

"
[u'france']|"AIRBUS FACES A340 DECISION AS DEADLINE LOOMS

The supervisory board of the European consortium, Airbus Industrie>, has begun a critical meeting to review government funding and airline orders for its proposed A340 long range jet, Airbus officials here said. Airbus insists it needs five airlines to firmly commit themselves to the plane before going ahead with the project by the month's end, the deadline for its launch. The plane, a four-engined widebodied jet, has so far only been bought by one airline -- Lufthansa>, which has placed 15 firm orders and 15 options for the plane. But while Air France has said it wants to buy seven of the aircraft, it has not yet formally placed an order. Discussions with up to a dozen other airlines have not yet resulted in public commitments. Apart from a shortage of orders, Airbus also is facing an uphill struggle persuading its member governments to fund the 2.5 billion dlr project, which involves not only the A340 but its sister A330 aircraft, a twin engined, wide bodied medium range jet with many identical components. The British government remains unconvinced that there will be sufficient room in the world long range jet market. The West German government is also uncommitted, and is currently pressing for a restructuring of the consortium's West German company, Deutsche Airbus GmbH>, while only the French government appears to be fully behind the program. Another major factor delaying a final decision on the plane has been the engine which will power it. Airbus agreed last October with CFM International> that its CFM-56 engine with 28,600 lbs of thrust would power the plane. But in December, Airbus announced an agreement with CFM rival International Aero Engine> (IAE) to power a slightly larger version of the A340 with a 30,000 lb thrust high-technology superfan engine. Airbus has made clear to potential customers that the IAE engine is now the principle engine for the project. The incorporation of the superfan engine made the plane on paper more attractive to airlines, but the engine has yet to be developed and CFM International had openly expressed scepticism that the engine will be ready when the plane goes into service. The future of the Airbus consortium depends on the right decision being made on the A340 in the next few weeks, for it could find itself severely exposed in the 1990s either by staying absent from the long range jet market or by committing itself to a commercially unviable project.

[u'usa', u'sprinkel']|"U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING DEFICIT

Senior U.S. Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets. Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth. By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987. Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments. He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely. Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988. Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, ""It looks pretty good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports."" He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding, ""It looks like they're on track."" While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit, Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact. The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives, he said. ""Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform,"" Sprinkel said. ""In 1986, this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family."" Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit. In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said. Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same. ""Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years,"" Sprinkel said. ""This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,"" he added. However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided. ""Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit) are unpleasant,"" he said. Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the ""biggest sustained inflation in our nation's history,"" which helped foster widespread distrust of government. ""The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level,"" Penner said. ""But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot."" Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year. He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed. ""I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there's no ... Way to enforce it,"" Penner said. Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets. ""Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved more than two billion dlrs,"" Penner said. REUTER "

The United States this week signaled it is pressing commercial banks, increasingly disenchanted with providing large cash loans to debtor nations, to develop new ways of financing that will prove more acceptable to both sides. Heading off challenges to its Third World debt strategy, U.S. officials also say they think concessions should be made to debtors that enact reforms speeding inflation-free growth. In particular, they stress new techniques that shift the emphasis from debt to equity and shave interest rates. ""The strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative or concept that there can be additional emphasis such as in debt-equity swaps and that sort of thing,"" a Reagan administration official said of the slow pace of commercial bank lending to the Third World. ""The debtors have been performing well...some people argue that taking 1-1/8 pct down to 13/16 pct is debt forgiveness. Well if that's what it is, fine. What it really is a narrowing of the spread that could be charged on new money,"" the official said. This week, therefore, U.S. officials signaled their backing for a novel proposal by the Philippines that called for partial payment of interest in tradeable investment notes. On Tuesday, officials said Treasury Secretary James Baker told Secretary of State George Shultz the idea was a creative one and signaled his approval to Philippine Finance Minister Jamie Ongpin later that day. An administration official told Reuters this week the Philippines' proposal to partially pay interest with investment notes instead of cash should be considered seriously by the banks. An agreement with the banks, officials now say, is expected soon. ""New bank lending has been slow in materializing but the fact of the matter is there have been 70 billion dlrs in bank loans restructured, which is a form of extension of credit. As you know, there's been 8.5 billion dlrs in new money,"" said the official, who plays a key role in keeping the plan afloat. The plan was launched in October 1985 by Secretary Baker and called on commercial and multilateral banks to lend 29 billion dlrs in the subsequent three years to major debtors undertaking reforms that promoting economic growth. But it has taken almost six months to complete the syndication of a 7.5 billion dlrs loan to Mexico, which has created deep misgivings here about the liklihood of such large straight cash loans being assembled ever again. U.S. officials want the banks not only to consider swapping their debts for equity in local corporations -- a development that has already met with success in Chile and Mexico -- but to pin loans on specific projects, finance trade and invest directly in debtor country private sectors. These forms of lending, they say, give the banks a greater stake and more economically secure return on investment. In a major challenge to the U.S. plan, Brazil last month declared a moratorium on interest payments and followed it up with a world tour by officials seeking a political way out of its 109 billion dlr debt burden. The country is beset by a falling trade surplus and dwindling reserves endangering its ability to service its foreeign debt, at 109 billion dlrs the Third World's largest. One official attending the Washington talks with Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said ""they've come in here now and said ""Look, we're out of money, help us,"" but they haven't come in with a plan. And they've gone all over the world, and at every stop they've been told the same thing."" The official said Brazil would have to enact a credible economic program, either in consultation with the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund, to cool its overheated economy before commercial banks would begin negotiations. As a result of the Brazilian action, private banks and major debtor nations redoubled their efforts to reach agreements stretching out debt repayments. For its part, the administration has signaled its strong support for new techniques that in some cases effectively amount to interest rate concessions for major debtor nations. It pressed the banks to allow Chile to make annual instead of bi-annual interest payments, speeding an accord. Administration officials, who asked not to be named, have also debated whether to allow banks greater flexibility in building up loan loss reserves against Third World loans. The debate centers on a rule, known as FASB-15, under which banks experiencing delayed interest payments on real estate loans need not set aside reserves against debt principal if it is believed payments will resume. More recently, the rule was extended to cover farm and energy loans and Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat, has suggested it should be extended to Third World loans. Bradley is prominent among Congressmen urging that provisions for debt relief be attached to tough new trade legislation now being considered on Capitol Hill. But the officials said the debate has been inconclusive. Reuter "

U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct in February after a revised 0.1 pct increase in January, the Federal Reserve Board said. The Fed previously said industrial production rose 0.4 pct in January.

Industrial production stood at 127.3 pct of the 1977 average in February and was up 1.7 pct from a year ago, the Fed said. The Fed also revised the December industrial production figure to a gain of 0.5 pct from 0.3 pct originally reported.

Output of consumer goods rose 0.6 pct after falling 0.3 pct in January and output of consumer durables was up 2.1 pct in February after falling by 2.0 pct in January. Business equipment production rose 1.0 pct in February, reflecting more output of autos and trucks for business use and a recovery from strikes in farm equipment industries, the Fed said.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) board of directors issued a letter to its members that sets limits, but does not ban, dual trading in the S and P 500 futures and options pit. The rules prohibit brokers who execute customer orders to trade for their own account, or engage in dual trading, from the top step of the pit -- which the board defines as a geographically advantageous position in the pit. Brokers who engage in dual trading in other areas of the pit must record to the nearest minute those personal trades. The board will also set as yet unspecified percentage limits on the trades brokers can conduct among ""broker groups,"" otherwise known as ""trading rings."" By issuing its own rules, the CME's board rejected a petition presented in February by some CME members that sought to prohibit dual trading of any kind in the S and P 500 pits. The full CME membership will vote on the petition, since it was rejected by the board, by April 13. If the members reject the petition, the board would be free to implement its rules, a CME spokesman said. However, the members can vote to adopt the petition and institute a total ban on dual trading. The board's rules on dual trading, if implemented, would prohibit brokers from trading for their own account once they have executed a customer order from the top step of the pit. ""It's a step in the right direction,"" said stock futures analysts William Marcus of Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette Inc. ""It's very difficult to engage in large broker business from anywhere but the top step,"" he said. ""If there were abuses, (the rules) should act to curb them,"" Marcus added. The spokesman for the CME said the tenor of the board of directors' letter to members appears to leave open the possibility of additional limits on dual trading. In addition, the limits set forth so far will have to be more closely defined. Reuter "

Citicorp denied financial market rumors that it has written off some of its loans to Latin American debtors, ""Rumors that we have written off any of our Latin American debt are unfounded,"" a Citicorp spokesman told Reuters in response to London-based rumors in the money markets. Citicorp is the largest bank group in the U.S. and one of the biggest lenders to Latin America, with some eight to nine billion dlrs outstanding to Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, bank analysts said. In response to more specific market rumors that it had taken action on its exposure to Brazil, Citicorp said it made an 8-K filing on the subject with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday in relation to a registration statement for a preferred stock issue. Citing the filing, Citicorp said that Brazil's recent suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt and related actions ""may require Citicorp to place 3.9 billion dlrs of intermediate and long-term Brazilian loans on a cash basis."" When loans are placed on a cash basis, interest or principal payments are only booked when received instead of being accrued on their due dates, analysts noted. However, Citicorp said in the 8-K filing that ""it is premature to make such a decision at this time in view of the fluidity of the situation and management's high confidence in the long-term outlook for Brazil."" Brazil's new central bank governor Francisco Gros met senior commercial bankers here on Wednesday and Citicorp said formal talks on Brazil's recent actions and future financing needs should begin in ""the near future"". Citicorp said in the filing, ""the issue will be re-evaluated at the end of the first quarter."" The bank group continued, ""if it is decided that these loans to Brazil should be placed on a cash basis, Citicorp estimates, based on existing interest rates, that the impact in the first quarter would be approximately 50 mln dlrs after tax and for the full year would be approximately 190 mln dlrs after tax."" It added that these amounts include interest accrued in 1986 that has not yet been collected. Although Citicorp denied earlier rumors of major loan writedowns, its warning that it may have to place some of its Brazilian loans on non-accrual unnerved many Wall Street investors. The common stock price was down one dlr to 51-1/8 after the first hour on a volume of over 500,000 shares.

The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. ""The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common,"" said one economist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose against EMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow the mark's rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community. Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system -- the French franc, Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change. ""Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level,"" said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department. Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they predict. REUTER "

General Mills said at the end of the third quarter, its return on average equity was 31.6 pct.

Negotiations on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, are approaching the make-or-break point and prospects for a future pact appear to be in the balance, delegates said. Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, chairman of the INRA renegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a small group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major outstanding issues. When the talks began on Monday Xuto said those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to allow time to draft an agreement during the second week. The talks are due to last until March 20. Xuto said, ""There is nothing concrete yet, but the atmosphere is good."" The discussions are expected to continue late into the night, and Xuto said he may hold weekend meetings. Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to which price adjustments should be automatic. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price (set at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the current agreement) for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers want the council to have the last word and have resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure. Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling another issue -- that of the floor price. It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, called the ""lower indicative price,"" under certain circumstances. This means that any possible compromise would centre on the reference price, and the ""may buy"" (or ""may sell"") and ""must buy"" or ""must sell"" levels, without changing the ""lower indicative price"" -- which is set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents in the current pact. Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on the floor price question, producers may consider agreeing to another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at 12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.

[u'usa']|"U.S. FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT

Proposals for a secondary market for the resale of farm real estate loans similar to home mortgage markets is gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and could be established this year, Congressional and financial sources said. Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market have been introduced in both the House and Senate. Furthermore, Representatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankers and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree on a method of establishing the market. Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture ""as long as the farm credit system is a key player."" Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the secondary market could be established either with Congressional legislation or administratively. Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the successful resale markets in home mortgages, the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), industry sources said. Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main supporters of a farm loan secondary market because they believe it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in rural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system, traditionally the largest lender to farmers. A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell high-quality loans on farmland to ""poolers"" who in turn would package the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities for resale to investors-- called Aggie-mae by some supporters. However, the FCA and financially-troubled farm credit system have in the past been ambivalent about the idea. The ambivalence is because any farm secondary market established in the private sector that excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a competitive disadvantage. That could be a financial blow to the system, which has lost 4.6 billion dlrs in two years, Naylor and farm credit system officials have said. A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the secondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers, concludes the farm credit system's market share in rural lending would fall if a secondary market were established. The study was released earlier today. Reuter "

[u'uk']|"FRN PANIC INITIATED, EXACERBATED BY MARKET MAKERS

Today's panic in the floating rate note market has been simmering for months and is, in many ways, of the market makers' own doing, traders and bank officials said. ""For the last six months, there have been a series of crises in the FRN market. Each has cut deeper and deeper into the very fibre of the market,"" said a senior official at a U.S. Bank. As prices have fallen, he explained, the underwriters who originally brought the issues have retreated. They have divested themselves of the paper as quickly as possible, unwilling to bear losses of the magnitude seen in recent panic trading. In the virtual effective closure of the market for perpetual floaters last month, bankers witnessed the consequences of this kind of contraction of liquidity and investor confidence. Fears were engendered about the possibility of this crisis infecting the market in conventional dated FRN issues, which is almost 10 times as large as that for perpetuals, with an estimated 130 billion dlrs of debt outstanding. ""The professionals are so nervous about holding inventory that they will sell at any price,"" said an official at a leading U.S. Bank, explaining the panic selling which has pushed prices down sharply over the last two days. Bankers and FRN traders emphasised that today's trading was unique in that it was driven exclusively by professionals and that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the securities they sold. In highlighting this point, dealers noted that the benchmark issues in the FRN market -- the two FRN's for the U.K., Launched in 1985 and 1986 -- fell an unprecedented 50 and 40 basis points, respectively, at the opening this morning. Certainly, dealers said, Britain is no less credit-worthy today than it was yesterday and the country's economic health currently appears better than it has for some time. Pointing out that this kind of sovereign and supra-national debt had not sagged on any fundamental weakness, one senior FRN source said: ""The idiocy of the situation is aptly shown by the fact that these kind of borrowers can now tap the syndicated loan markets at rates lower than their floaters currently pay."" Dealers agreed that banking sector paper, which constitutes a significant part of the market, was currently under pressure. Floating rate debt of major U.S. And Canadian banks eased markedly in nervous trading last month on renewed investor fears about the banks' exposure to Latin American debt. The U.S. And Canadian money centre bank FRNs, along with Republic of Ireland paper, were hard hit again this week with dealers citing one heavily-traded Citicorp note falling to levels so low it is now effectively yielding 55 basis points over Libor (the London Interbank Offered Rate). By comparison, the 500 mln dlr note which matures in 1998 yielded only a fine 20 basis point over Libid (the London Interbank Bid Rate) when it was issued in January last year. Price declines of this size can really only be explained by an understanding of the operating practices of leading players in the market, dealers and banking analysts said. ""This has to be understood as a matter between banks who have a brief to buy low and sell high,"" one U.S. Bank source noted. Another senior source at a U.K. Bank drew attention to the enormous overhead costs and high salaries generated over the last few years in the FRN market, which have to be justified. But even beyond the cost of running an FRN trading desk, dealers said, is the way the securities are bought and sold. Although sophisticated on-screen dealing exists in most markets, in the euro-markets trading is conducted by telephone. ""If somebody calls you up and asks you to make him a price in any issue, and you do, he can say ""Right. You own five mln',"" a trader said, explaining market practice. The unfortunate buyer is then forced to unload the securities just minutes later to yet another firm at an even lower price, the trader explained. It is precisely this phenomenon that forced the rapid downward price spiral earlier today, traders said, adding that it is likely to continue until the markets either regain their confidence or market practices change. One possible solution, dealers said, would be to initiate trading exclusively through brokers' screens, so that only those who wanted to buy bonds would have to ""lift a bid"" or buy at that price. Meanwhile, bank regulators are apparently concerned about the implications of the collapse in FRN prices. Traders in London said that the Bank of England has called around to market makers asking whether they intended to continue trading and what they calculated the losses to be. The Bank often makes periodic checks in the market, but dealers said the latest enquiries were more specific. A spokesman for the Bank of England was not able to comment immediately on the Bank's action. One trader at a major U.S. Bank here said that in addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's international capital markets unit has phoned banks in London today seeking information about trading in FRN's. He also said that this was not an unusual procedure. Reuter "

[u'usa']|"PROPOSALS TO RELAX U.S. DRUG LAWS POSE PROBLEMS

The Reagan Administration's soon-to-be published proposals to make experimental therapies more rapidly and widely available to terminally ill patients pose product liability problems for drug companies, experts in the pharmaceutical field said. Details of the proposals will be published in the Federal Register shortly and will become effective after a 90-day comment period. Under the proposed policy, announced Tuesday by Commissioner of Food and Drugs Frank E. Young at a press conference, patients with life threatening diseases who are not enrolled in clinical trials would be allowed access to an experimental therapy. The policy also allows drug companies to sell the promising drugs to patients. Previously drugs like AZT could be rushed into wider use free-of-charge if the agent was shown to be effective. Under the new policy, the FDA could only refuse to permit a physician to administer an experimental drug if it was shown to be unsafe. Financial analysts said the plan would likely benefit biotechnology companies with few or no products approved for marketing in the U.S., but would have little economic impact on large drug companies with many other sources of revenue. ""Charging a fee for still experimental drugs could help biotech companies' near-term financial situation and help make them less dependent on outside sources,"" said Teena Lerner, a biotech analyst at L.F. Rothchild. Other observers were concerned that drug companies would be put into a legal bind if promising drugs later proved to have devastating side effects. ""Before a lot of drug companies release these drugs they are going to have to think long and hard about liability--the product liability problems are enormous,"" said a Washington-based lawyer who specializes in the drug field. Patients in clinical trials normally sign lengthy informed consent papers before taking an investigational drug. The lawyer said no more than two cases had gone to trial for suits against a drug company's investigational drug. ""The new proposals are a whole new kettle of fish,"" said the lawyer. ""Drug companies are right now probably meeting with their insurance companies."" Burroughs-Wellcome Co, the U.S. arm of the British firm Wellcome PLC that makes AZT, Merck and Co Inc MRK>, Hoffman-LaRoche Inc and SmithKline Beckman Corp SKB> said it was too soon to comment on the policy. ""I'm very uncomforable with this,"" said Wellcome spokeswoman Kathy Bartlett. ""We haven't had a chance to formulate a response yet. It's too early."" But some financial analysts say the proposals would benefit drug companies. ""I find the proposal to be a very significant alteration of the FDA's past policies that should positively affect (drug companies') stocks,"" said drug analyst Davis Saks, with Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy and Gardner. Saks also warned that many health care providers would balk at the proposal, and would call it ""amoral"" to charge patients with life-threatening diseases for drugs that otherwise would be given out for free in clinical trials. Jeffrey Warren, spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, which represents the major drug firms in the U.S., said ""A mechanism already exists at the FDA permitting certain seriously ill patients access to experimental drugs and perhaps that system can be approved."" Warren acknowledged that the PMA may not be able to come up with a consensus among its membership when the rules are formally published. He also admitted that product liability problems could be a concern to major drug companies. Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, which is actively in AIDS policy and funding issues, cited the drug Suramin from Bayer AG BAYRY>, which had shown early promise as an AIDS treatment, but on wider clinical testing was shown to have deadly side effects.

[u'west-germany']|"GERMAN SECURITIES MAY BE COUNTED IN LENDING RATIOS

West German banking authorities are considering requiring German banks to bring securities holdings into lending ratio calculations used to regulate credit risk, banking sources said. The present interpretation of the credit law limits banks' maximum lending to 18 times eligible capital -- reserves plus equity capital -- but sets no restraints on securities holdings. Under new provisions, weightings would be attached to securities similar to those used for lending. Weightings would range from a zero rating for no-risk assets to 100 pct of total asset value for what authorities consider the highest risk. Low-risk securities carrying a zero rating would include public authority bonds for the federal government, states and municipalities, the sources said. A 20 pct rating would be assigned to issues of domestic banks. Secured bonds of mortgage, shipping and public authority banks would be an exception to this, via such securities as mortgage and municipal bonds.

Talks between France and Iran on the repayment of a one billion dlr loan by the late Shah have made progress, Roland Dumas, head of a parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee said. ""They are progressing as far as I have heard,"" Dumas told reporters. ""The two delegations appear to be near an agreement on the figures."" Dumas, a close aide to President Francois Mitterrand, earlier this week met Iranian Charge d'Affaires in Paris Haddadi Gholam-reza. The report of progress contrasts with official French statements last month after talks between Deputy Iranian Finance Minister Mehdi Navvab and the French Finance Ministry. The talks, the latest round in long-running negotiations between the two countries, were said to have led to little progress on the loan repayment issue. France made a first repayment of 330 mln dlrs last November. Since then negotiatiors have shuttled between Tehran and Paris for talks which France hopes will help secure freedom for hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. Iran is claiming full repayment of principal and interest on the Shah's loan, made in 1975 to the EURODIF uranium enrichment consortium. It has also asked France to curb the activities of Iranian dissidents in France and stop selling weapons to Iraq, its enemy in the Gulf War. France for its part has made a counter claim for more than 500 mln dlrs in compensation for contracts with French firms broken after the 1979 revolution. REUTER "

[u'canada']|"TALKING POINT/DOME PETROLEUM DMP>

Dome Petroleum Ltd's revised debt restructuring plan keeps the company alive and improves its appeal as a takeover target, but full debt repayment depends on a sharp oil price rise, oil and banking analysts said. Dome's complex proposal to let creditors link some or all of their debt to oil-indexed debentures or convert it to equity is ""very cut and dried and to the point,"" Peters and Co Ltd Calgary-based energy analyst Wilf Gobert said. Dome ""is saying, This is the way it is. There isn't enough money to pay you back,'"" he added. The plan ""strikes me as a very pragmatic thing to do,"" First Marathon Securities Ltd oil analyst Jim Doak commented. He said the plan seeks to formally tie payments to creditors with the price of oil, which governs Dome's cash flow and ability to service its debt. Dome expects its total debt to reach 6.4 billion Canadian dlrs by June 30, 1987, when an interim debt rescheduling plan expires and Dome hopes to implement the long term plan. Gobert said the plan would rank secured and unsecured creditors in a complex series of repayment categories or ""an agreed pecking order of what your (creditors) claim to assets is."" Potential suitors would find Dome easier to swallow under the debt restructuring plan because it proposes to resolve competing claims on assets pledged to secured creditors and on remaining unpledged assets, Gobert and others said. ""Certainly the restructuring plan, once it's agreed to and put in place, is going to make it easier for someone to come in and look at doing a deal on it (acquiring the company),"" Gobert remarked. ""It's going to be a lot easier than it is right now because you'll have settled the pecking order question,"" he added. Gobert believes the debt plan may be partly motivated by a desire to sell Dome Petroleum as a whole. ""If the creditors wanted to liquidate their bank loans they could do it in an orderly fashion through the sale of the company, as opposed to dismemberment,"" he said. Dome's proposal includes rescheduling secured debt payments over a 15 to 20 year schedule, linking payments to cash flows generated by assets pledged against loans and establishing interest rates that allow for changing oil prices. Creditors' only real alternative to Dome's plan is ""an asset grab which would liquidate the company at distress prices, and the banks would spend the next 20 years in court deciding who had what asset,"" First Marathon's Doak said. For Dome's creditors, the plan does not offer a quick method to recover loans, but extends payment time in the hope that oil prices will rise, increasing the amount of the company's debt payments, Merrill Lynch Canada Inc bank analyst Terry Shaunessy said. The plan ""is not a solution. It says give me more time and let's keep our fingers crossed that oil goes way up."" Doak and Shaunessy estimated oil prices would have to rise to about 28 to 30 U.S. dlrs a barrel to fully service all of the company's debt. Analysts said the plan would ensure the company continues to operate, but provides little other benefit to common shareholders. ""From a common shareholder standpoint, all this does is sort of keep him on the life support system, because there isn't any equity unless you get a big increase in oil prices,"" Gobert remarked. Analysts said Dome's common shares, trading today at 1.12 dlrs, off four cents, on the Toronto Stock Exchange, essentially represent a long term warrant pegged to oil prices. ""You have to be looking at an extremely high price of oil in the context of historical trends before there's any residual value for the common shareholders,"" analyst Doak said. While Dome's plan said lenders will be able to convert debt to common shares, the amount of dilution depends on share conversion prices still to be negotiated and how much lenders would choose to convert, the company said.

[u'usa']|"WHITE HOUSE SAID HOLDING OFF DECISION ON BUDGET

Congressional budget leaders are asking President Reagan to join in a bipartisan effort - or even a summit - to write a new budget, but White House chief of staff Howard Baker said no decision has been made yet, a Senate source said. The request for White House cooperation was made yesterday by Senate Budget Committee chairman Lawton Chiles at a meeting with Baker, the source said. The appeal came as the Senate Budget Committee made plans to start drafting next Tuesday a fiscal 1988 budget plan that Democrats controlling Congress hope to get through both chambers by April 15. House Democrats have been meeting privately and will continue discussions on Tuesday to develop a plan for the full committee which holds its first drafting meeting Thursday. Reagan's own budget was submitted in January but Congress generally has rejected it as unrealistic, with the Congressional Budget Office saying the deficit is understated and should be a more realistic 134 billion dlrs. Among major controversial decisions that Congress has to make are levels of deficit deductions to meet the Gramm-Rudman budget law target of cutting the estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for 1988 to 108 billion dlrs. A key decisions is the amount of new revenues - Reagan proposed some 22 billion dlrs in asset sales and excise taxes - as part of a deficit cutting plan. Reagan, who opposes new taxes, refuses to say he is advocating higher taxes through his revenue scheme. The Gramm-Rudman law sets fixed deficit targets for Congress with the aim of wiping out huge deficits by 1991, but over the past two years deficits have exceeded the targets. The Senate source said that Chiles asked for cooperation to avoid clashes when the Senate and House Budget committees start writing separate budget plans for congressional approval, starting next week. The source said Chiles told Baker ""If you start working sooner, rather than later you have a chance to do something before everyone gets locked in."" Baker has had conversations about the budget problem with Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, and with House Speaker Jim Wright. Baker reportedly said that he plans to have further talks with other Republicans and House Budget Committee Chairman William Gray ""before the the White House decides what it is going to do, if anything,"" the source said. House sources said that Gray --who has been pushing the idea of a budget summit with Reagan--is anxious to work with the White House to get a compromise budget plan. Besides reaching decisions on actual spending and revenue levels in a new budget, congressmen are considering adjusting or redefining the targets of the Gramm-Rudman law to make them more realistic. Reagan presented about 36 billion dlrs in spending delays, cuts and revenues he said will reach 108 billion dlrs. Gray has said that if Congress approves 36 billion dlrs in reductions, the deficit would be 134 billion dlrs realistically because of what he says are more accurate economic assumptions. Reuter "

Midland Bank Plc MDBL.L> said its Greenwell Montagu Securities unit would pull out of equity market making and concentrate instead on providing a broker dealer and agency service for its clients.

A spokesman said Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged, which is a primary gilt edged market maker, and Greenwell Montagu stockbrokers, were not affected by the decision. The market making operation had encountered much greater competition than had been expected in the post-Big Bang period, the spokesman added. Although Midland considered that the operation would be viable in the long term, it would require the concentration of greater resources than could be justified for an operation that was not a core Midland activity. He confirmed Greenwell Montagu Securities had been losing money in past months. The pull out from market making would be conducted in an orderly fashion in the near future. There might also be some job losses, he said without giving any details. Market sources said it was no great surprise that a market maker had pulled out, as the intensity of competition had suggested for some time that sooner or later someone would decide to withdraw. They said some retreat by Greenwell had been likely because of its losses, and added there also been speculation that it could pull out of market making in gilts also. The move was unlikely to have any major impact on market confidence, as the occasional speculation in the past few weeks had had little impact. Analysts said commission rates on institutional equity trades have dropped sharply in the five months since deregulation, with some firms covering some of their reduced profits by trading on their own account.

Antonio Ortiz Mena, president of the Inter-American Development Bank, warned that if Latin countries were unable to speed up their economic growth, then in the long run there would be a default. He told a press conference foreshadowing the bank's annual meeting next week, ""For the banks it is convenient to be repaid. But to achieve that, the countries need to grow. If they don't, then in the long run there will be a default."" Ortiz Mena warned that Latin America needed to reverse the capital outflows from the region and beyond that needed more resources. Ortiz Mena declined to agree with estimates that capital outflows from Latin America last year totaled 35 billion dlrs and that therefore he was calling for an inflow into the region above that sum. He said the U.S. debt strategy, which envisaged stepped up lending by commercial and multilateral banks to major debtor nations of 29 billion dlrs over three years, was insufficient to achieve the necessary rates of growth. But he did stress the U.S. plan was important and the right approach. Ortiz Mena said, ""It is in the interest of the creditors, not only the debtors, to push forward the development process in Latin America and that has happened."" He added, ""The only problem is the resources have not been enough."" Turning to Brazil, whose growth rate he predicted will decline slightly this year from 1986, Ortiz Mena said the country's moratorium was the right action in order to avert a long term default. ""So it's preferable they negotiate now,"" a move which would eliminate any chance of panic in the markets. Ortiz Mena also said that Brazilian authorities have opened negotiations already with commercial banks. He pointed out Brazil took the action because of its deteriorating economic situation. Reuter "

[u'interest', u'gnp', u'ipi', u'wpi', u'usa']|"FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U.S. FEBRUARY ECONOMY

U.S. February reports reflecting slim gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said. ""If you're the Fed, there's no reason to do anything,"" said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc. ""There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflation front, all is well,"" he said. ""Money supply is well under control. It's an absolutely ideal situation."" February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected. This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's production number, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase. The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct, less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct rise in the PPI in January. ""The Fed is going to look at this positively,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation. ""Certainly inflation is not as bad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants."" The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in February, after a 9.8 pct increase in January. ""This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel,"" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ""The trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year."" In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct decline in the PPI. Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected, but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the Federal Reserve. ""The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International. While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar. ""The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,"" he said. ""We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with foreign producers."" Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct in February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced overseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said. If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish overseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices. By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987. Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire, and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar. David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S. industrial output. ""It's the other side of the lower dollar,"" Wyss said. ""Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output."" Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter. ""It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive."" But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output. Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production. Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2 pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced, not that manufacturing activity gained. Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5 million units.

[u'usa']|"U.S. FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT

A secondary market for resale of farm real estate loans similar to markets on home mortgages is gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and could be set up this year, Congressional and financial sources said. Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market have been introduced in both the House and Senate. Furthermore, Representatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankers and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree on a method of establishing the market. Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration, FCA, which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture ""as long as the farm credit system is a key player."" Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the secondary market could be established either with Congressional legislation or administratively. Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the successful resale markets in home mortgages, the Government National Mortgage Association, GNMA, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), industry sources said. Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main supporters of a farm loan secondary market since they believe it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in rural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system, traditionally the largest lender to farmers. A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell high-quality loans on farmland to ""poolers,"" who in turn would package the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities for resale to investors -- called Aggie-mae by some proponents. The FCA and financially-troubled farm credit system have in the past been ambivalent about the idea, mainly because any farm secondary market established in the private sector which excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a competitive disadvantage and could be another financial blow to the system, which has lost 4.6 billion dlrs in two years, Naylor and farm credit system officials have said. However, the system and FCA have become more positive to the idea recently because the system could benefit if it were appointed the agent for a secondary market. ""If the farm credit system were the guarantor of the pools of farm mortgage loans, it would benefit from the fees charged for providing this service,"" the Life Insurers' study said. Congressional sources believe a secondary market available to both private lenders and the farm credit system, with the system as agent, could be included in a major federal government rescue package for the system to be drafted by Congress later this year. A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the secondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers, concludes that the farm credit system's market share in rural lending would fall if a secondary market were established. The study was released earlier today. The study said a secondary market could be established with virtually no federal money if the government provided a guarantee of 90 pct of the farm loans but a private co-insurance plan guaranteed the first 10 pct of any losses. It estimated between 500 mln and two billion dlrs of the eight billion in new farm real estate loans issued each year would qualify for the secondary market in the first few years, expanding significantly later as investors accept the idea. The study also said interest rates charged to farmers who meet the underwriting standards of a secondary market would fall 50 to 100 basis points due to the new resale market. The possible interest rate declines are a major reason why leading U.S. farm organizations such as the American Farm Bureau Federation have recently endorsed the idea. Proponents say a secondary market also would increase liquidity in farm lending, and spread the risk of such loans. Reuter "

ecuador cannot service its debt owed to private foreign banks due to the earthquake that forced a suspension of crude oil exports, central bank officials said. ""we hope to obtain a tacit, explicit acceptance from foreign banks ... that we are not able to service the debt,"" central bank president carlos julio emanuel said. ""the reality is that our debt service capacity has been totally affected by the recent cataclysm,"" he added in a news conference last night. A central bank spokesman said emanuel was referring to payments owed private foreign banks, already suspended since january. These banks hold two-thirds of the country's 8.16 billion dollar foreign debt. Emanuel was not refering to debts to foreign governments and multilateral organisations, the spokesman said. The march 5 earthquake damaged an oil pipeline, preventing crude exports for a projected five months. Oil generates about two-thirds of ecuador's total exports and as much as 60 per cent of the government's revenues. Emanuel did not specify how long ecuador would be unable service private foreign banks. But finance minister domingo cordovez said two days ago the government is seeking to postpone all payments due to private foreign banks in 1987 until next year through negotiations with creditors. Emanuel said ecuador was seeking soft loans from multilateral organisations for reconstruction work.

Mobil Corp chairman Allen E. Murray said in the annual report issued today that the company's total 1987 capital expenditures would be lower than the three billion dlrs spent in 1986. ""Overall capital and exploration expenditures will fall slightly below the level for 1986 although we'll be ready to increase spending whenever the outlook becomes more promising,"" Murray said. Mobil data in the annual report shows capital expenditures have been cut every year since 1984's 3.6 billion dlrs to 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985. Murray told shareholders that despite the cuts ""the company has promising acreage to explore as well as major oil and gas reserves to develop in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa and Indonesia. Over the past two weeks Mobil has announced restructuring of its domestic exploration and development organization and this week a restructuring of its oil services units, which support the new affiliate. ""Mobil's chairman has explained this change by saying we need a leaner organization to get more efficient usage from our assets,"" said John Lord, a Mobil Corp spokesman. Murray said in announcing the first reorganization, which will combine its current three exploration and producing affiliates into one organization, Mobil Exploration and Production U.S. Inc, that it is more effective than the present organization and will improve the company's upstream competitive position.

Brazil's labour troubles eased a little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing troops from the country's main oil installations occupied three days ago. The troops went in at the request of the state-oil company Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil industry employees. Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their willingness to negotiate a pay deal. A national seamen's strike, however, continued and marines remained in the country's main ports. The marines were despatched to the ports after the seamen's strike, now two weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday. A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135 in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports. Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase. Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a sign that the national strike could soon come to an end. Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union leaders said the vast majority of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still on strike. The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de Janeiro next Wednesday. Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator. Besides industrial troubles, there has also been considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector. On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies throughout the country to protest against high interest rates. Television reports showed some of these protests still continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana. The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a deterioration in its trade balance. On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to private banks. Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange. Reuter "

CitiCorp CCI> appears to be digging in its heels for tough negotiations over the billions of dollars in loans that Brazil owes to money center banks, Wall Street analysts said. ""I view it as pre-negotiation posturing,"" said analyst Carole Berger of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc, referring to both Brazil and Citicorp. Brazil recently stopped paying interest on its commercial bank debt. Today, CitiCorp said its first quarter income would be reduced by 50 mln dlrs after tax if it lists the loans as non-performing status. Citicorp filed an 8-K form with the Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating a material change in its financial situation. ""Citicorp is saying you can't scare us with threats, we'll make your loans non-performing right now,"" Berger said. The loans have to be treated as non-performing after 90 days without a payment. CitiCorp said only that the situation will be reviewed at the end of the current quarter. Berger asserted that Brazil is doing its own politicking by talking to U.S. regulators and trying to drive a wedge between U.S. and European banks. Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Merrill Lynch and Co said it is unlikely the situation will be resolved until the second half of this year. ""Ultimately the Brazilians are going to have to pay up on all the interest they owe,"" Cohn said. ""The real issue is the rescheduling of debt terms. Another question is whether or not the International Monetary Fund can help Brazil with a new austerity program. Stocks of money center banks were mostly down fractions in late dealings. One trader most stocks in the group bounced off their lows by midday as investors took the news in stride. Cohn said the bank stocks may be risky until numbers on non-performing loans are reported for each bank. But he said investors looking ahead six to 12 months might want to buy at present levels for the ""tremendous fundamental values"" in the group. Analyst Robert Gordon of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said Manufacturers Hanover Corp MHC) has the greatest exposure to Brazilian loans of any New York bank, in terms of percentage of earnings. He said his only two recommendations currently among New York banks are J.P. Morgan and Co JPM> and Bankers Trust Co BT> which happen to have the least exposure. Gordon said his positive opinion on J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust was not merely a response to the fact that the two have lower exposure to Brazilian loans than other banks. In fact he said there's a chance those banks could get more involved in the future. He noted that Morgan has already set up a brokerage subsidiary to deal in loans to less developed countries. ""I don't see any reason to change full year earnings estimates, said Frederick Meinke, analyst at E.F. Hutton Co. He thinks the confrontation with Brazil could end in a replay of a situation that occurred with Argentina in 1984 and 1985. Meinke noted that in the case of Argentina the loans became non-accruing for a couple of quarters but then when the banks came to an agreement with Argentina all the back interest was paid. ""What it did was distort the quarterly earnings pattern,"" he said. He said in the case of Brazil write-offs of loans is a worst-case outcome which is highly unlikely. He noted that Brazil is a country with a diversified economy, going through some economic upheaval after the transition from a military to a civilian government. ""The countries of Latin America have too much debt relative to their ability to service it,"" said John Mason of Interstate Securities. ""We've been fiddling around with these problems for five years and the hour is growing late."" He said up to now the banks have reduced their spreads, cut interest rates internally and extended maturities and none of these measures has been enough. He expects re-classification of as much as a third of the loans as non-accruing and he sees partial write downs of some loans. Nevertheless Mason thinks the money center bank stocks could be poised for a short term rally. A spokesman at First Chicago Corp FNB> said it is premature to put Brazil's loans on a cash basis. ""It is our expectation that economic development will allow Brazil to meet its debt,"" a spokesman said. Bankers Trust in New York said it would be premature to make a decision.

The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said. The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about 17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean energy ministry official said. The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic demand. The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an earthquake the night before. The tremor ruptured the country's main pipeline from jungle oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific Ocean. Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the earthquake. It would take about five months to repair the pipeline to Balao, government officials said. Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mln dlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake, energy ministry Javier Espinosa said. Reuter "
[u'usa', u'ec']|"USDA'S EXPORT BONUS SAID TO AFFECT TRADE TALKS

The U.S. Agriculture Department's Export Enhancement Program, EEP, contributed to the recent agreement to include farm subsidies in the new round of global trade talks, according to the General Accounting Office. GAO Senior Associate Director Allan Mendelowitz told a Senate Agriculture subcommittee that the EEP has increased the cost of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy. However, there is little reason to believe that once EEP expires, gains in U.S. farm exports attributable to the program will be sustained in targeted markets, he said. Mendelowitz said broadening the EEP by making it across-the-board would eliminate charges of discrimination by traditional buyers and increase pressure on the EC, but antagonize non-subsidizing exporters.

Chrysler Corp's Chrysler Motors unit said it increase the price of its Chrysler Fifth Avenue luxury sedan by 300 dlrs to 15,966 dlrs. The higher price applies to cars produced by Chrysler at the American Motors Corp's AMO> Kenosha, Wis., assembly plant, where Chrysler shares production with American Motors. Shipments of Chrysler cars from Kenosha began March nine. Chrysler in the past year transferred production of the Fifth Avenue and two other car models to Kenosha from its St. Louis Number Two facility. A Chrysler spokesman said the price increase will cover the cost of moving the production line. The spokesman said the higher price will apply only to the Fifth Avenue. Prices of the other two Chrysler models--the Plymouth Gran Fury and Dodge Diplomat--made at Kenosha will remain unchanged. Chrysler moved production of the three large rear-wheel-drive cars to Kenosha in order to build stretch minivans at the St. Louis facility.

[u'grain', u'corn', u'ussr', u'usa', u'argentina']|"NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING

A greater than anticipated need, competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking Soviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officials said. As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely. First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last year's Soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln announced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain. A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect Soviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said. Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its Argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln tonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also cut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes. Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this year's corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln tonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR. ""Significant downside potential"" still exists for the Argentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow. ""If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can provide during the April to June period,"" he said. Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked Soviet buying. U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Soviet sources said. ""This price difference makes American corn competitive,"" Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union, told Reuters. Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause those prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. corn futures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said. Finally, some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains agreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping to convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat. In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretary Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat subsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out. Reuter "
[u'usa']|"FAIRCHILD INDUSTRIES FEN> CLOSES PLANT

Fairchild Industries Inc said it will close the Fairchild Republic plant at Farmingdale this year, and sell it next year, after agreeing with the U.S. Air Force to terminate the T-46A trainer aircraft program. John Sanford, the Fairchild Republic unit's president and vice president of the corporation, said Reublic will fulfill its remaining current obligations, but will cease work on the T-46A immediately. Fairchild said the unit has already delivered two protoype and one production T-46A. Sanford said lack of additional Air Force funding for the trainer due to budget constraints prompted the termination agreement. Sanford added that without the T-46A or business to replace the work, Fairchild was forced to close the plant. Fairchild said it expects to retain about 200 engineers and technicians at a small operation to be set up in 1987 on Long Island to continue providing technical support for the Air Force's A-10 aircraft. Fairchild added that its Fairchild Composites/Bonding Center, formerly a part of the Fairchild Republic operation, will become an independent operation. Paul Wright, Fairchild president and chief operating officer, said, ""With the settlement of the T-46A issue we have put behind us the last of two problem aircraft programs that caused the company heavy losses over the past two years."" Wright added that the company can now move forward with its restructuring to emphasize on growth areas in aerospace, communications, electronics and its commercial and industrial businesses. Earlier, Fairchild reported losses from continuing operations in 1986's 4th qtr of 3.2 mln dlrs, or 44 cts a share. This compares with a operating profit of two mln dlrs, or a loss of eight cts a share, after subtracting the provisions for preferred shares, in 1985's fourth quarter. Fairchild reported 1986 operating net of 7.6 mln dlrs, or a loss of 34 cts a share, after provisions for preferred shares, versus a loss of 283,000 dlrs, or 93 cts a share, in 1985. Reuter "
